Thanks for the copy-edit, OMG it reads so professional. ) I appreciate it a lot. Yeah, I knew that that would be a problem. Okay, here's the """"back story"""" to it. Danny had body paint while he was a robot during a sketch. During the after party, in which the theme was a black light one, everybody could see that Danny still had paint on him, as it hadn't washed off or something. To be sure, Jack had a black light switch in his apartment, and when Liz came in, he turned it on, which resulted in Liz having the paint all over her, see here. Or if whatever I just said doesn't make sense, read here and here (about the paint still on Danny and the black light attack).
Yeah, I thought maybe if people saw that, the GA note, they won't leave me a message. Though, that didn't work, as a user left me a message regarding an article I reviewed. This has to work in the future. I'm a have to make it better. I still haven't gotten the chance to see it, but I have to see it. I need to know what happened and stuff. Well, after I got the news that he lost, I started watching his DVD and telling myself that I'll never see his wrestling moves again. I didn't cry, I  was just sad. The night on Raw, I lost it and cried. Whatever, I didn't think that was cool. Shawn didn't mind, but I did. Not really, I still don't see that """"face"""" like quality to him.

 Lead 

What's there now is not a summary... summaries are supposed to be substantially shorter than the text they summarize, which the case at Salvatore Giunta is not. It simply copies whole sentances from the body text. As an editor, we have to assess the article as it currently stands, and not any hypothetical future stance. If the article grows, then the lead can be adjusted accordingly. In any case, the lead section I favored does indeed summarize the most important part: the MOH.

I support the idea of wikicode. Basically I think we should present code in a Python-like language that doesn't carry so much baggage.

Fair use rationale for Image:TranquilityPark.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:TranquilityPark.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too.

The BNP was modernised by Nick Griffin and has no links to Holocaust denial or Nazism. Digging up 20 or 30 year old quotes is irrelevant. You can do that for all parties as many change their ideology. The modern Labour party are not the traditional Labour party, just how the Conservative party are no longer traditional Conservative Tories. During the heydey of the British Empire the Conservatives were pro-imperialistic and supported the colonisation of other countries, do you think the modern conservatives under Cameron support that? Another example: The Green Party in UK used to strongly oppose drugs, yet now they support drug-use and want to ban the prohibition of drugs and support the possession, trade and cultivation of cannabis. So they went from being anti-drug to pro-drug. The modern BNP has no links to Holocaust denial. Secondly, the comment about Nick Griffin and the RAF bombings is a typical distortion of what he said by anti-BNPer's. What Nick actually said is that the RAF should not have bombed German innocents (children and woman) as many were murdered in the Bombing of Dresden. Likewise he also opposed the bombing of innocent British civilians by the Nazis. Also the last claim modern BNP members sieg heil, i presume was a comical claim. It has no basis in fact. BNP are strongly against Nazism and Fascism. If you want a real fascist organisation that would be the UAF (Unite against Freedom), who attack BNP members with clawhammers and other weapons etc. Is that democratic?

2c11412908449ee1,"The Malvern Water cure
For what it's worth, I concur that the Malvern Water article benefitted from the exercise. To me, the best indicator that (User:Jerem43 was acting in good faith on 12 November 2009, with the Talk:Malvern Water#Advertising tag was that it was Jerem43 who removed it following Gyro's efforts. I came to that article late, so wasn't caught up in the earlier argy-bargy (so to speak). But I see that since the efforts surrounding that period, both the article and its discussion page have settled down completely. 

There certainly was quite a bit of reference to the Malvern Water article in our discussions. Mostly this was to contrast two referencing styles and layouts. One 'exemplified' by Malvern Water, and one 'exemplified' by Shakespeare. Mind you, the William Penn article might benefit from the latter style (but not necessarily). I counted 74 individual page citations for Hans Fantel's 1974 book - nearly double that of Schoenbaum (1987) in Shakespeare.

The above discussions highlight another thing which the Malvern Water article exemplifies. How one can sometimes find the solution in the problem. The problem being the criticism, and the solution in this case being to take it in good faith, and see what transpires - in this case an improvement. Of course, this might not always be the outcome. But assuming criticism as being in good faith generally raises the chances of a favourable outcome. Not everyone knows how to constructively criticise - we typically learn that through experience, if we're lucky (in my own life, I'd have handled many past situations differently in light of what I now know). And by acting as if the criticism or editing changes are in good faith, if perchance they are maliciously based, that will become so self-evident that it's impossible for any reasonable person to miss. Even then, what may have started out as malicious may resolve favourably if the other editor gets a kind response. A funny old world indeed, what with that and the irony that the Malvern Water cure still seems to be working its magic!   Wotnow",0

 Some things to note about Stalin 

1., Many and most photos of Stalin are either heavily doctored or even fake. He was known to aviod photographers because his face was ugly from heavy pitting and canker. He had a number of better-looking doubles (stand-ins) to serve in PR opportunities. He used to stand on high/remote pedestrals when must appear in public to avoid close scrunity.

2., It is a commonly held opinion in Eastern Europe (I think it is a fact) that Josif Dsugasvili was an ordinary highwayman by profession before he joined the revolutionaries. He used to rob trains with a grops of outlaws, forcing people to stand and deliver.

3., Isn't it strange the Stalin Wikipedia article does not include the word dictator / dictatorship (or anything that starts with dict*) at all according to IE's search? Political correctness should not run amok, especially considering this is english language Wikipedia and US people know very little about foreign relations and history by school education, so it is easy to indoctrinate them by """"kind ol' Uncle Joe"""" babble. Or do you think only ancient roman leaders can be called a """"dictator"""" per definitionem? Most of Stalin's actions were clearly outside the realm of politics (which means debate and negotiations vs. headshot) so calling him a politician is an offense to leaders who spent their entire life serving their nation and all of its citizens in accordance with the people's will.

4., Did Stalin murder his wife? Has this issue been settled conclusively?

5., Hungarian people depicted while expressing their most sincere sentiments towards dead Stalin by toppling and decorating his giant statue in Budapest during the 1956 revolution:

You are Stalin apologets. Where is placed the mention of Katyin massacre, where several thousands of polish POVs were shot by NKVD upon Stalin's personal order? We hugarians are very close brothers of the polish people historically, so I find the lack of proper and emphasized mention of Katyin very painful. Stalin's crimes against Poland are amongst the most outrageous in written history. There is no excuse to the Molotov-Rippentropp pact. Make no mistake that was the Hitler-Stalin pact.

I really wish Stalin ruled you, not us. You are like Rumsfeld, who met Saddam during mid-1980s and praised him as a good ally in the anti-Khomeini Iran war. When will you realize that Putyin's current rule is an analog of Stalin's, characterized by extreme disregard for law, anti-semitism (most notably the early 50's doctor trials vs. 2004's Khodorkovski-Yukos) and imperialism (brutal military actions in the Caucasian Mountains both times and desire to the rule neighbours). Thus, by not mentioning Stalins criminality in unambigious terms, you hold the english-speaking world blind to Putyin's methods and you contribute to a """"new Uncle Joe"""" sentiment, which will inevitable put the world and the poor Russian race in great danger. A repetition of history for those who refuse to learn about the past.

Stalin started his reign with a few million dead, by reversing Lenin's post-civil-war """"new economic policy"""" of limited private agriculture thus leading to big famine.

The entire WWII in Europe would be over in 6-9 months had Stalin failed to entirely decapitate the soviet army's elite in 1937-39, this is clearly written in vol. 2. of soviet published seven-volume """"The history of the Great Patriotic War 1941-1945"""". You are plain stupid to praise Stalin for a """"hard earned victory in WWII"""".

So powerful was the fear of Stalin's evil power, that even us hungarians, who previously fought three revolutions and independence wars in the last 300 years, did not dare to raise again until autumn 1956 to free ourselves from stalinism. Anglo-saxons betrayed us big time then, shame on the Free World.

In churches renovated after WWII (big destruction in Hungary) the face of the Satan (as defeated by arch-angel Michael) is always of Josif Stalin's on wall paintings. People were shot for painting that.

 Saath Nibhaana Saathiya 

Hi again. I understand your willingness to help clean-up the (perhaps) poorly maintained articles of Indian television shows. I myself have contributed towards helping make the Saath Nibhaana Saathiya article somewhat more readable, although I haven't yet begun the momentous task of cleaning up the """"Plot"""" section, which would involve either watching several episodes or collating sources for episode descriptions. It is something that I will try to help clean-up shortly.

However, I have rearranged the cast table once more. My reasoning for this is that the actors names have never been promoted by the channel. They have always been referred to as their characters. Visit the Star Plus website (only the characters are mentioned)... look at the opening credits (only the production team is referred to)... and look at the promotional programming such as the Star Parivaar Awards (the actors names are never mentioned, and they accept awards dressed as their characters). This does imply that the name of the character looms larger in the public consciousness than the name of the actor, no matter how frustrating it may be from an encyclopedic point-of-view. Therefore, the character name is the most relevant to readers/visitors of Wikipedia, and it is these names that should be credited first, not the actors.

We only know the names of some actors thanks to sources such as The Times of India or other websites referenced on the Saath Nibhaana Saathiya page. Let me know.

(By the way - what did you mean in your edit description, """"third grade book report""""? I don't take kindly to being insulted. I'm merely trying to make the page functional and relevant, like you, and petty insults don't help matters.)

 Dear Leslie fyans, hello, and welcome to Wikipedia! I hope to not seem unfriendly, but I'd like to bring to your attention the conflict of interest guideline which explains the potential incompatibility between the purpose of Wikipedia to produce a neutral, verifiable encyclopedia, and the purposes of an individual editor. Conflict of interest editing often involves contributing to Wikipedia in order to promote yourself, your friends or family, or the interests of other individuals, companies, or groups you are closely associated with. When an editor disregards the aims of Wikipedia to advance outside interests, they stand in a conflict. Please review this guideline, and you may wish to also review the notability guidelines as well. Thank you for your interest in Wikipedia, and I hope you'll find many helpful areas! Sincerely, Ariel♥Gold 
Hi Leslie, I'm placing this here for your review, as your submission to articles for creation was specifically about yourself. Also please see Wikipedia:Autobiography, along the same lines. Normally if you are notable enough, reliable, third-party sources will exist, and an article will have been written. If you are notable (again refer to the notability requirements), but the article does not exist, you may request it, but either way, you should not edit an article about yourself, as explained above, as it would be quite difficult to remain neutral, which is one of the core policies of Wikipedia. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Thanks! Ariel♥Gold """,0

I know that the Croatian perspective is somewhat different. This comes from a very specific historiographical school, which had among its roots Grga Novak. Assuming that Dalmatia was one of the most primitive of Europe at the time of Venetian domination, we must also think that since 1797 to the date you specified (1945) they are 150 years. Josip Smodlaka stated in 1911 (1911!) that Dalmatia was still one of the poorest regions of Europe. As you can understand, we can not talk only of the Italian evil foreign rule to explain this fact.

 Unreliable sources misquotes source 

Your source for the extirpation by whalers of the Atlantic gray whales is suspect. Among the two sources it cites is Bryant's 1995 paper on Atlantic gray whale specimens. Bryant (p. 860, right column) merely speculates that whaling may have been the cause of its disappearance, stating that """"This population of gray whales apparently disappeared during periods of active coastal whaling on both sides of the North Atlantic, supporting the possibility [my italics] that whaling activities were responsible for, or at least contributed to, its extinction"""". However, these whaling activities (as far as we know) primarily targeted right whales, as I stated above. Earlier (p. 860, left column) he asks """"Could the eastern North Atlantic gray whale have been extirpated by whaling activities? Unfortunately, early whaling activities off the coast of Europe are poorly documented.""""

9de37631fa34b018,"""It is precisely because Presley is singled out for such criticism that it should be mentioned. Well that is your opinion. I would go a different way: The famous musicians (or their fans) who accused him should show their sources (they have the advantage of being alive and are able to defend themselves against accusations). It would make more sence to me to write about the obvious racism of Chuck D and Mary Blidge and a lot of other famous people than about Elvis' non-exixting racism. I think it's is unfair to the music and cultural impact of Elvis that such things got too much space in the article and other much more essential aspects of Elvis did not get mentioned. I think people who are interested in the person and music of Mary Blidge or Chuck D should discuss it on the discussion site of their articles in wikipedia. They should find out if there is racism or not. Or maybe start an article """"racism in showbussiness"""" and dicuss it there. I think you should not let  it become your problem that some people (for instance Chuck D and Blidge obviously) have problems with 1.Elvis being white , 2.the fact that he was from the rural south, 3.that they believe what other people say only because they share a similar pigmentation and repeat it without checking out any sources or 4.that they wanted get simply attention. By the way - Do you think this musicians ever heard one of  A. Crudup's or Kokomo Arnold's songs or even Roy Brown? I think you could write that Elvis was target of racism and accused of being a racist and mentioning some source and footnotes. But for an article about Elvis it is too detailed the way it is. I think give Elvis credit for what he did - positive and negative - and not for what he did not do.

About Elvis meeting the Beatles: Okay they met and there was no chemistry between them. Did it have any impact on Elvis? He did not like the Beatles before and not after they met. It is another anecdote from Elvis' view. But I think it would be worth reading in a article about the Beatles or John Lennon. He meant much more to them than the other way around (positive or negative). I only gave details about the meeting I've read in a german book which proably was not published in english language. It shows a very negative behavior of Elvis and I wished he would have act different but the sources are that way and having the Beatles Anthology on dvd I could see and hear  Ringo Starr telling the story (only McCartney was very, very kind, maybe even a little bit white washing).

I would like to know what you think about my comments about Berry, Perkins, Kokomo Arnold etc.. I think it tells something about the accusation of stealing music. Heard several years ago an interview with Dave Bartholomew when he played in Switzerland where he said he listened with Fats Domino to many songwriters black and white, blues and country, and he bought the best songs, arranged and changed them and put his name (and Dominos) under it. He said that was common and he knew from some former Ellington musicians that the Duke did the same. 87.162.47.181   Franco, Deutschland

Hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in Republic of Macedonia the things will go in right direction: Removing the Bulgarian Propaganda from Macedonian articles, cleaning them of false fabricated information, and giving the facts to the world, and the views of the Macedonian Science and sources.
I don't have much time now, but hopefully will be able to find some more in the coming period. I am open to any collaboration|effort for the above goals.",0

I understand that you are keen to contribute to our article on fields. Now that your block for edit-warring has expired, you must decide how you want to progress this. I notice that while blocked you continued to edit the talk page with an IP. This is not permitted and I would be within policy and custom to reblock you for this, see WP:SOCK. I decline this time to do so, but I warn you not to repeat this or further measures will be taken against you. I hope this will not become necessary as you will not require to be blocked again. Do not edit war, see WP:EW, but discuss with your sources (see WP:IRS and WP:V) on the talk page, under your proper account. 

I know that editing here is a steep learning curve and I am willing to help you do it right. You must accept that we are a mature community with very well-established policies and customs. If you come here you have to work within that, just like if you get a job in a university you have to listen to the people who are already working there. I can tell you have a lot to offer to the project. Please make your arguments in talk, be patient and kind to the folks who wrote the article (I am not one but was asked to look at this by someone who is. This does not mean I endorse their opinion on how the article should read.) even (especially) when you disagree with their writing, and accept that you will seldom get all of what you want, just as in most areas of life. I am a volunteer just like you, but I have been around for a good while and I am entrusted with the janitorial role of making sure that things don't get damaged. In support of that role I am allowed to block users, protect articles from editing and certain other powers. I would very much rather not use them any further here. I am also a science graduate, and have some passing understanding of the subject you are here to edit, for whatever that may be worth.

Please resume your discussions in talk, but please do not edit-war or sock again. Let me know if you need any further help and I will be glad to offer it to you.   

My voice is important to me, if you take it upon yourself to snuff it out, or otherwise misrepresent it, in my book you are not out to help. 

The good cop bad cop, all-in-one schizo stuff is kinda weird; & your paternalism is waaaay off the mark. Ignoring you was not """"unwise"""", & I am hardly intimidated by your inadequate mastery of the rules you wish to nail to the wall. Perhaps you should review these dictates more closely yourself & check your double standards at the door. I am speaking of editing my criticisms of your actions amongst other things.

I did not start an """"edit war"""" as you imply. Your issue was personaldisobedience to be exact, with a sprinkling of that self empowering sparkle which lording over others endowsthe joy of duct tape & racquetball, which only a cop-at-heart can understand. I did not practice deception as you imply with the """"sock puppet"""", I signed my name to every puppets comment. I am not a perp, as implied by your actions in sum. Therefore you are barking up the wrong tree. I don't buy it that you are a robot bound to regs just doing your job as implied; you are a person making choices & you chose bad faith & laziness.

The generalisms you sincerely & patiently list, I'm sure are relevant in the wider context & larger community that you refer to & I'm sure what you do is of value there. I don't envy your job. In this case, however, we're talking two people debating in a forum, & an article that needs to be kept safe & sterile from any potential change lest something terrible happen! Is the cop/citizen ratio so mature in this community that there are resources to police such minor quibbles? Where am I Disneyland? Tracking IP's attached to names in order to reign in such terrorism is downright dumb for a supposedly progressive community. See WP WTF

If you place an obedient noob filter on any & every minor impulse-response test that passes though looking to improve upon the low grade blasphemy passing itself off for knowledge, you will reap what you sow. The page will never make it to the C grade it claims to be.

I do care about the subject, & *your* site is misrepresenting it for years now. I will continue to do what I can to fix it, with or without your rules if it's important to you that you stand in my way. There has been zero effort to address the fundamental criticism brought up a year ago now. How many people are going to bother explaining themselves after stroking a potentially infinite series of well meaning, but primarily self-serving policy enforcers hovering over a page, in order to change a few sentences?

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Help:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing. (There is a college-level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue.) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to verify information and to demonstrate that the content is not original research.

If you own the copyright to the source you want to copy or are a designated agent, you may be able to license that text so that we can publish it here. However, there are steps that must be taken to verify that license before you do. See Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials.
In very rare cases (that is, for sources that are public domain or compatibly licensed), it may be possible to include greater portions of a source text. However, please seek help at the help desk before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources may not be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you do confirm that a source is public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see Wikipedia:Plagiarism for the steps you need to follow.

 """"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them,"""" 

and then in Gen 2:7:

 """"then the Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature,"""" 

followed by Gen 2:21:

 """"So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.""""

These passages contradict one another.  The first states man and woman being created together.  The second two have Adam being created first, followed by Eve.  If a person believes that the Bible is the word of God then both are correct.  So, to make them both correct there has to be a first woman followed by Eve.  Which is how the idea of Lilith came about - filling in the gaps to make both versions true.  If a person believes the Bible is the inspired word of God, written by men capable of error, there is no need for Lilith.

But, I can tell you from my experience thus far, many """"intractable"""" neurological and orthopaedic conditions that have been referred for surgery are simply neuromuscular imbalances that are very treatable by chiropractic care and manual therapies.  Maybe it's time to revisit the notion that DCs just """"crack backs"""".

Regarding your comment on the possible side effects (headaches, dizziness, numbness), pale in comparison to the side effects of many medications used to treat pain syndromes.  Now, to clarify, I'm not against medications at all, however to fear manual therapy, including manipulation, is not supported by the research.  To call my profession a pseudoscience shows either a lack of awareness of chiropractic in 2008 or ignorance (take your pick).  In an evidence-based era, no health profession can escape the responsibility to demonstrate  clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness through research.  I suggest you start reading manual medicine journals so that you can better inform your colleagues of contemporary physical/manual medicine practice.

Mütze, I asked questions on my article, not on avoiding the publishing of my article!! I follow the Wikipedia rules to the letter and this discussion is only to clarify the """"problems"""" people might have with my article. Obviously, you Mütze, your only problem is that you wish me not to publish this article. Very soon, this  article will be published and you will have to leave it this way; otherwise, the censors at Wikipedia will be forced to side with me (!!).

Excerpt from the book by Grateful Dead Bass Player Phil Lesh:

The unique organicity of our music reflects the fact that each of us consciously personalized his playing: to fit with what others were playing and to fit with who each man was as an individual, allowing us to meld our consciousnesses together in the unity of a group mind.

For us, the philosophical basis of this concept was articulated by the science-fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon in his novel More Than Human, wherein the protagonists each have a single paranormal talent – telepathy, psychokinesis, teleportation – and are joined by a quadruple paraplegic who acts as a central processing unit. The process by which they become one is called bleshing, from a combination of mesh and blend. (Today’s archetype would be the X-Men.)

Now I'm going to put the page back the way it was.  And I'll add this reference to it.

Moeron, you might want to consider discussing this with us before you go ahead and try to change it again.  No one that I know of appointed you Keeper Of The Deadhead Page.",0

""""Kittredge's administrative power, vast erudition, prestige, and the histrionic attitude he assumed with undergraduates provoked resentment.""""  Although I wrote this myself, I now see that it is a vast oversimplification. The quarrels over the philological method were more complex than this and have been gone over in Gerald Graff's book. Graff and Wellek reflect their time in that they are clearly biased in favor of """"criticism"""" over and against philology. Nevertheless, critics of philology did have a point. Not everybody needed to study Gothic (or even Greek) in order to teach or study English. And the controversy over how to reconcile research with the requirements of general education is still with us  indeed the purpose of a liberal arts education is still in doubt. I haven't figured out how to deal with this in a concise manner but will make some additions later  not to mention dealing with the """"communal"""" theory of composition of folk ballads that Kittredge was accused of promoting.173.77.100.252  """,0

I find it just hilarious that a website that has an article dedicated to a topic such as this can't handle cussing. But hey, anything to divert attention away from the real issue. To me, the real issue is whether the article is made better or worse by an edit. And while SlimVirgin may have fixed a verb tense or two in his massive edit, the overall result, including the deletion of important embedded notes being replaced by unfounded questions of accuracy and urban legend, made the article far worse than it was. Several other problems have been listed as well. None of which, apparently are problems in SlimVirgin's mind. Apparently they all make the article better. 

What we have is one massive diversion here. The article was made worse. But SlimVirgin can't admit it. Instead he will divert attention by saying his change was simply """"copyediting"""", that I and another editor are trying to """"own"""" this page, that it all comes down to editors like me inserting unsourced edits, that I'm POV, and finally that I swear too much. SlimVirgin, you have acted as nothing but a victim of your circumstances. You have not taken responsibility for a SINGLE thing you have typed on the article or the talk page. It is ALWAYS someone else's fault.

This is what I'll admit to doing: I admit I broke wikipedia's rules and swore on the talk page. I'm not particularly sorry about it, but I'll take down the language if people have that much of a problem with it. Every single other accusation you, SlimVirgin, have leveled against me is false.

Imagine finding an article in which every single word is wrong and you will imagine my pain at reading the current Martin Heidegger article. Nor am I the only one who thinks this. Please see the section immediately above this article. Or better yet, spend the next 24 hours reading the first sections of Sein und Zeit and you will see the ridiculousness of the article as it currently stands, which demonstrates no understanding of Heidegger, and leaves everyone who reads it dumber than  when they began and knowing less about everything. This is so atrocious that essentially the entire article as it stands needs to be deleted and began again. I have no more time for this.   

I tried to move the Dreyfus to the main article and now apparently all the material is destroyed. Do you have any comprehension of how bad this article currently is? One would have no idea that Heidegger was ever read anywhere outside of France from the current article. No summaries of Heidegger's important concepts are given. No understanding of any of Heidegger's ideas are conveyed. Since you have decided to destroy my work, you can keep your poor article, which reads as if it was machine-translated from a foreign language. You do not even let someone in the middle of working finish before you destroy their work. No wonder zero academics contribute to this site and your articles are so atrocious. Anyone who reads the article as it currently stands comes away knowing less about Heidegger than they did before because of all of the obvious distortions and gross inaccuracies. You have not even succesfully explained a single one of Heidegger's terms or concepts here, or why anyone should care who he is. This article is an embarassment indeed.   
Words are important rather than space on the screen because people have different size screens. I have a 27 inch screen and a 5 inch screen, both of which I edit on.

Monmouth County may be the one county with the most number of small incorporated municipalities, and it makes it difficult to show all the legal borders.  The townships could be shown easily, but there are 20 or more small boroughs along the coast that hardly show at all.  I could add an outline map to the county page, if it would be helpful, but it would be hard to label everything.   

I added an index map to the Monmouth County, New Jersey page.  Take a look and see what you think.

 Map data? 

Hi Jim, I saw your recent uploads of Image:Andover boro nj.jpg and Image:Andover twp nj.jpg and I was wondering where the map data came from, and what tools you used to put it together.  I'd like to make similar maps for other areas.  Thanks.  (t) 
The software was Manifold, the data was from multiple sources.  The administrative boundaries and water features were from the Census Bureau's 2004 Tiger/Line (second edition) files for Sussex County, the road network was from the New Jersey Department of Transportation, and the place names and locations were from the USGS Geographic Name Information Service files.  I used information from the Tiger/Line files to identify the divided highways.  The New Jersey state outline was from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics 2004 National Transporation Atlas Databases state boundary file.  
Interesting, but I think Manifold may be out of my price range.  Thanks for your contribtions, these are quite complex maps compiled from several public domain sources, good work.  BTW, is it possible to upload PNG or SVG output from Manifest?  The current JPEGs have compression artifacts, as JPEG was intended for photos, not solid-color-region graphical data.  See Wikipedia:Preparing images for upload.  Thanks.   (t) 

Thanks, I changed all the maps to PNG files.   

 Thanks for the maps! 
Hi Jim, I also appreciated your maps for Sussex County and the ones that seem to be appearing as I type for Passaic County. I have been part of a small group working on Wikiproject New Jersey, a project aimed at filling in the holes and expanding the details regarding New Jersey in all its aspects. While there are portions of the state covered by your maps, and those ChrisRuvolo has created, we could definitely use maps for all of the 566 municipalities in the state (plus the CDPs and unincorporated areas if possible). Any assistance that you could provide in creating and uploading maps, or in providing guidance in their creation, would be most appreciated. We could divvy up the map creation work so that we can ensure that the whole state is covered, and not just by one or two people.  

I think the maps are great, and I see that Warren County is underway. My only question is that on some of the maps, particularly for smaller municipalities (e.g., Belvidere, New Jersey), it can be hard to distinguish between the highlighted municipality and the rest of the county. Is there any way to change the colors to improve the contrast? Other than that, keep up the great work!  

Some of the smallest places do get lost.  The larger red label was an attempt to highlight the principle location on each map, but at the scale of the map, there isn't much to be done for the small places.  I started out mostly interested in showing the township outlines, since most of the online street map servers don't show township outlines.  Once I have a county set up, it is relatively easy to produce an entire set of maps all at the same scale, but it would be much more work to change the scale or colors for individual towns.  Maybe there will be time to revisit the smaller places later on.

 Missing system? 

This page from the Organization of American States has a table about midway through it. In the section Mexico is has several different hurricanes listed. Between Janet and Tara there is a gap that appears to indicate an unnamed hurricane. The table attributes 960 casualties to this mysterious unnamed tropical cyclone. It also indicates that it took place in October, 1960. The problem is, this mysterious system is not in the best track. The last named storm in the Atlantic was in September. In the Pacific, the only October systems were Hyacinth and perhaps the deleted Gwen.

 The British National Front was and is 'far-right', yes? Let's not whitewash in this article. 

In putting the term 'far right' before 'National Front', and removing the uncited last line that appears to promote Griffin (""""Since he became the leader of the BNP several educational institutions have invited him to speak on political radicalism, multiculturalism, and BNP policy."""") I have been reverted and accused of 'vandalism' by a regular editor here, User:Parrot of Doom. I would like to say that nobody WP:OWNS Wikipedia articles, and it is against Wikipedia policy to use the term 'vandalism' for an essentially 'POV' issue (POV means someone expressing a point of view) - especially one that is effectively factual - namely the NF being 'far-right'. Wikipedia describes the NF as """"a far right and whites-only party"""" in its main article - and this fact was as true when Griffin was a member of it as it is now. I also gave the clear reasons for removing the promotionally-phrased last line - so I'm not a vandal.

Having maintained that the National Front is indeed 'far right', can anyone really claim that adding this fact to this article is unhelpful or irrelevant? The current introducton gives very little real flavour of Nick Griffin (and his obvious 'notoriety' is left out completely), which compared to other Wikipedia articles on politicians is pretty scandalous in my eyes.

I suppose that technically you could, but not legitimately, as no reasonable person (or human) would do this.   Your false claim is that you """"think my edit was a test"""".  First of all, if someone is doing a test, and the test fails, then they would of course fix it or change it back or add a hidden comment for someone to fix it or something.  But, secondly, this was the second time you have changed the clarification of the sentence back to be grammatically incorrect and extremely confusing, so you could not possibly """"think it was a test"""", and what you wrote in the edits also says that you didn't think that.                     ~Rayvn  """,0

b58bc33c05908881,"Health care is rationed in the United States.  This happens in public hospitals that provide care for the uninsured and those patients participating in socialized systems such as Medicare and Medicaid.  For example, there is a greater demand for dialysis, Xigirs, colonoscopies, and new technologies like HeartMate than what is being supplied to these patients.  Instead of spending more money to meet the demand, demand is artificially lowered through denial of treatment or waiting times.  This is rationing in the normal sense of the term.  Rationing is not normally used to refer to being unable to afford certain health care services in a free market system.",0

Wrong. All 36 sources name the word country or countries. Not a single one of them names the neologism """"Countries of the United Kingdom"""". Please read the ext refs.

In line with Wikipedia's policy requiring that statements be supported by external refs, I applied the following lead:

'''Countries''' is a term used to describe the constituent parts '''of the United Kingdom''': [[England]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]. While ''[[country|countries]]'' is the most common term used to describe them (especially England and Scotland), they are also described as ''[[nation]]s'', ''[[constituent country|constituent countries]]'' and ''countries within a country''.[http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page823.asp Number 10] [[English people|English]], [[Northern Irish people|Northern Irish]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Welsh people|Welsh]] nationals are all entitled to [[British citizenship]]. (The [[Irish nationality law|nationality laws]] of the [[Republic of Ireland]] entitle those born in Northern Ireland also to citizenship of the Republic.)

This was immediately reverted by UKPhoenix79. Plus ça change. We cannot go around inventing new terms and presenting them as pseudo fact.   """,0

I would like to reposta updated version my comment from the discussion above before this one was also started (making 3 sections with the same discussion): I agree with Saturn the tally should only look at the present. Right now I can count 7 in the thre section on this talkpage for keeping the established consensus for now (option B), that is NextUSprez, William S. Saturn, 68.58.63.22, JayJasper, Ariostos and myself. And I can count 5 in the thre sections on this talkpage for chancing it now (Any other option), that is Rollins83, Tyrol15, Virilk, 99.165.226.1 and Belibaste. Without taking a vote I also see a consensus about restarting this discussion when the election is over. Not trying to stop anyone for speaking and discussing more, I am looking forward to hear new good arguments, but my suggestion to the consensus would be (The wording migt be a bit wrong): 
The Photos of Obama and Romney """"campaigning"""" (B) stays until November 6, 2012. At that time a new consensus should be made, the suggestion from this Quorum would be to then use two more presidentiel photos as in the example C/E.
