## Problem 5

### Score Plot

The f1-macro score plots for different models I use is shown below:

From the plot above, we can see that the performance of PET models becomes better as the training set becomes larger. However, it can still hardly have the equal performance comparing to the BERT model. 

### Instance Estimation

As the size training data becomes larger, the performance of the PET will greatly increase. From my point of view, I think about 2,000 entries of dataset will make PET model have a close performance comparing to the BERT model.
