Thanks for the copy-edit, OMG it reads so professional. ) I appreciate it a lot. Yeah, I knew that that would be a problem. Okay, here's the """"back story"""" to it. Danny had body paint while he was a robot during a sketch. During the after party, in which the theme was a black light one, everybody could see that Danny still had paint on him, as it hadn't washed off or something. To be sure, Jack had a black light switch in his apartment, and when Liz came in, he turned it on, which resulted in Liz having the paint all over her, see here. Or if whatever I just said doesn't make sense, read here and here (about the paint still on Danny and the black light attack).
Yeah, I thought maybe if people saw that, the GA note, they won't leave me a message. Though, that didn't work, as a user left me a message regarding an article I reviewed. This has to work in the future. I'm a have to make it better. I still haven't gotten the chance to see it, but I have to see it. I need to know what happened and stuff. Well, after I got the news that he lost, I started watching his DVD and telling myself that I'll never see his wrestling moves again. I didn't cry, I  was just sad. The night on Raw, I lost it and cried. Whatever, I didn't think that was cool. Shawn didn't mind, but I did. Not really, I still don't see that """"face"""" like quality to him. I think they'll play Randy out like Triple H, you know, good with the crowd, but still have him """"heel-ish"""". Maybe cause all the new people are heel and they need some faces... who knows.

During the AE report that editor adds this to the policy. You then amend it  the edit summary of your edit is quite amusing considering the conclusion you reached at AE. That editor then posts Wikipedia_talk:Banning_policy#Clarification_in_the_interaction_between_site_and_interaction_ban and he hopes """"it is non-controversial?"""" Oh no, of course not, it is entirely uncontroversial to go and amend POLICY in the middle of an AE enforcement to ensure that a fellow EEMLer is let off without sanction. If this has happened once, chances are it's happened before right? It would indeed be interesting have a look at the previous appearances of Volunteer Marek at AE, and see if he got off without sanction as a result of deceptive shit going on in the background. I know of one occasion it did; on that occasion Piotrus went running to Newyorkbrad and wikilawyered his EMML buddy out of yet another block. It is for that reason, upon seeing that occur, and my block being left intact, that I sent Arbcom a number of emails to ask them what the fuck they were doing. Would anyone like to have a look at other instance, and see if that held true, and who the AE closing admin was. I know the AE from last year didn't see any possibility of Piotrus getting VM out of the shit; but instead, several days into VM's massive two week block (don't worry VM, it will be an indefinite block for you soon enough), Piotrus goes and awards VM a purple heart barnstar; the purple heart of course being awarded to those injured in battle; what a nice fitting tribute to the battleground that is Volunteer Marek's talk page  it's still displayed there. Perhaps a Polish speaker can tell us what it means?

Dear Ugen64, Please, kindly, I beg you. Allow me to delete the green skinned opera. It is very repulsive. Both of us do not want to frighten people who never tried Opera with that strange look. I suggest you take another screenshot using Cocoa this time. ) BTW what do you think of my very unoriginal idea of taking screenshots of the Opera page instead of the earlier pics of Wikipedia home page.  2 Dec, 2003

Well... thank you for the change -) btw do you use Linux? I mean whats that funny sort of greenish-brown border around Opera? (I will like the screenshot of the wiki-opera page, but its just fine)  23:40, 2 Dec 2003 (UTC)

In response to your question on the requests for adminship page: to find out how many edits you have, go to your user contributions page, and keep clicking """"next 50"""" until you get to the end of them, then make a note of which page you're on (e.g. """"#650-700"""") to get a count to within the nearest 50.  Click on """"hide minor edits"""" first if you want a count of only non-minor edits.  20:09, Dec 6, 2003 (UTC)
I hope mav doesn't count his edits this way! If anyone runs Python I can send you a script that is as nice as it can be to the server.  (talk) 10:29, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)

Hi, for military-theme articles like US 2nd Armored Division I generally use the dd-mm-yyyy style for dates because that is the US military standard, and that's what readers (US or otherwise) will expect to see.  Pretty much the only audience for mm-dd-yyyy is US civilian topics.  03:51, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)

No biggie, not every article is consistent on this point now. But there are hundreds of US military articles using dd-mm-yyyy, thought I'd save you thinking they needed to be changed.  04:04, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)

The first question is by far out of scope from my knowledge. Reading the German Wikipedia articles de:Veda (the English text is very similar Veda) on it my understanding is the following: there are four vedas (Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda, Atharvaveda). Bhagavad Gita is in the English and German Wikipedia articles listed under """"other scriptures"""" and Smriti, respectively. From my limited understanding I would conclude that the text is not a Vedic text in the narrow sense of """"Vedic"""". 
However, it seems to me that the term """"vedic"""" sometimes is used in a broader sense, basically meaning something like """"knowledge"""". In this sense it might be possible to classify the text as """"vedic"""".
From what I read from a few more sources I would not put it under """"vedic text"""", but as I said in the beginning I know so little about these things that no one should rely on it ;-)
Mmh, better I start thinking about your second question ...

I see that your reading incomprehension still persists. First of all:

""""In general, Wikipedia articles should rely on reliable secondary sources""""

This doesnt mean tertiary sources arent reliable. And:

""""General encyclopedias, like the Encyclopedia Britannica or Encarta, sometimes have authoritative signed articles written by specialists and including references. However, unsigned entries are written in batches by freelancers and must be used with caution.""""

is written under the part """"Advice specific to subject area"""" and """"History"""". 

In other words Encyclopedic sources and hence dictionaries are reliable sources, especially when we arent discussing a historic subject such as this one. I do hope that you develop your reading comprehension. Try to read lots of books.  """,0

Unfortunately, these two reviews are the newest ones available on trace amine receptors in relation to neuropsychiatry. I'm actually kind of puzzled as to why there isn't more activity in TAAR (particularly TAAR1) research... (emphasis added only as highlights)

If you happen to be interested in reading the full version of either paper, I can give you a download link or email you the pdf. The first one covers a lot more than just ADHD.
