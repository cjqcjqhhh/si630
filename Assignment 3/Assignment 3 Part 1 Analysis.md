## Pearson Correlation

Pearson correlation r between user 1 and user 2 is 0.6010744063414033 

Pearson correlation r between user 1 and user 3 is 0.4493229213026635 

Pearson correlation r between user 2 and user 3 is 0.5331338467998734

We can see the pearson correlation between user 1 and user 2 is the highest, while the correlation between user 1 and user 3 is lowerst. It implies that user 1 has more evaluations similar to user 2. Evaluations between user 1 and user 3 are the most different.

## Alpha

**alpha between user 1 and user 2:**

ordinal 0.5946857565752022 

nominal 0.3630753700890881

**alpha between user 1 and user 3:**

ordinal 0.4069843104038233 

nominal 0.192467171929949 

**alpha between user 2 and user 3:**

ordinal 0.5067063112029242 

nominal 0.2629594465063667



The order of 3 alphas match the order of corresponding Pearson correlations, meaning user 1 and user 2 have the most similar evaluations, while user 2 and user 3 are in the middle and user 1 and user 3 have least similar evaluations. It means we can generally reach an agreement to rate the answers, but there are still ambiguous using our rating guideline.

Ordinal scores are higher between my group’s ordinal and nominal α scores. This is because our ratings have ordinal relationships and this is included in our evaluation. Using ordinal alpha will include this agreement.

I think in practice we should use ordinal alpha because the scores we rate has ordinal relationships. For example, 5 > 4 > 3.
