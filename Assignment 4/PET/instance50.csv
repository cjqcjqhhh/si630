Thanks for the copy-edit, OMG it reads so professional. ) I appreciate it a lot. Yeah, I knew that that would be a problem. Okay, here's the """"back story"""" to it. Danny had body paint while he was a robot during a sketch. During the after party, in which the theme was a black light one, everybody could see that Danny still had paint on him, as it hadn't washed off or something. To be sure, Jack had a black light switch in his apartment, and when Liz came in, he turned it on, which resulted in Liz having the paint all over her, see here. Or if whatever I just said doesn't make sense, read here and here (about the paint still on Danny and the black light attack).
Yeah, I thought maybe if people saw that, the GA note, they won't leave me a message. Though, that didn't work, as a user left me a message regarding an article I reviewed. This has to work in the future. I'm a have to make it better. I still haven't gotten the chance to see it, but I have to see it. I need to know what happened and stuff. Well, after I got the news that he lost, I started watching his DVD and telling myself that I'll never see his wrestling moves again. I didn't cry, I  was just sad. The night on Raw, I lost it and cried. Whatever, I didn't think that was cool. Shawn didn't mind, but I did. Not really, I still don't see that """"face"""" like quality to him. I think they'll play Randy out like Triple H, you know, good with the crowd, but still have him """"heel-ish"""". Maybe cause all the new people are heel and they need some faces... who knows. Speaking of Randy, today's his birthday, turned 30.

King Air article
Bill, sorry for not responding sooner to your question about the military versions of the 90, and the general length of the article. I've been mulling it over, and I'm still not sure what would be best, but I'm wondering about splitting the article into one about the 90/100 series and another about the 200/300 series. That, to me, is where the logical split is, in a number of ways. The 200/300 (including 350), went by """"Super King Air"""", and while there's a lot of commonality between the 90 and 100, there's much less so between the 100 and 200 (the exception would be the 90F which borrowed the 200's tail, but I wouldn't worry about that). Plus, the PT-6A engine comes in two """"families"""", the large PT6A and the small PT6A (# of PT wheels being a big factor). The 90/100 KAs use small PT6s, the 200/300 use large PT6s, so there's a natural split there. If we split the article there, each would have a fairly decent length, and could possibly be split further down the road if they continued to grow. Just some thoughts....  """,0

The only mention of genre is in #5, which states: """"Category: songs"""" should be placed into ... one or more subcategories of Category:Songs by genre.""""  Nowhere does it say that the song itself should be placed in a genre category. Therefore,  Category:Reggae rock was removed.

Template:Infobox single#Parameters gives instructions for infobox fields.  Under """"Writer"""" it says: """"This field allows display of the song's writer(s). Separate multiple values using Flatlist.""""  Therefore, the songwriters were listed using flatlist.

9fb50884d1bd6281,"No it is not reasonable to assume. In fact, virtually every mutant power has been completely missrepresented and changed in this movie series. Further, almost every facet of the characters lives have been changed in this movie series, so just because something happens in one continuity doesn't mean it will happen in another. Further, the section is about his appearance in the movie, not in the comic, so any details from the comic are completely irrelevant for his character. And using his comic book powers for reasons why the film makers would bring him back is an opinion. His body is completely charaed. Every character said he is dead. The creators of the film have not gone on reccord saying he is coming back or hinting at it or anything of this nature. The mentioning of his near deathes happened in the comicbook, not in the movie. This section is about his appearance in the movie, therefore, adding comic information in reference to his comic character is irrelevent. Further, CAPITALIZING your words does not porve anything and is completely silly. Find a source that says he didn't die from the movie, or the creators, or anything. Do not use comic books as an argument. Although the films have basis in the comics, the film makers only take what they want and have shown considerable creative license throughout this film to change stories as they see fit (sebastian shaws origins and powers, weakening of magneto by only showing his magnetic abilities, making havok not be cyclopse's younger brother, changing mistiques origins, changing azazel's origins, etc). Therefore, you can only talk about Darwin's appearance in the movie, as he appears in the movie. His body is completely destroyed, every character said he is dead.

 Comments from RHB 

I am approaching this as someone who knows very little about the subject. I will give some high-level comments mainly on structure and content. There are copyediting and prose issues as well, but it is probably worthwhile to tackle the general problems before going into specifics. Before I start, one general point that you will see often in my comments is that there are at times new subjects that are suddenly introduced. Although wikilinks help, a clause or a few words of explanation would smooth the flow of reading for a person not familiar with the subject.

Background to the mission
This section seems a little long relative to the rest of the article. Unless there is a significant expansion planned for the rest of the article, I would recommend reducing this section. There are small details that do not add very much to the Augustine story, e.g., the origin of St Martin’s Church, the fair-haired slaves theory, the pope writing to various kings.
Bede is suddenly introduced without explanation.

Arrival and first efforts
The mission turning back to Rome is not explained. Is there a significance to what happened?
It says “…on the one hand… on the other hand…” but the two items mentioned do not seem to be in opposition as expected when this phrasing is used.
Augustine established first at Canterbury. Since he was the originator, it might be good to give a reason why he chose the location.
The Archbishop of Arles is suddenly introduced. Who is he? Was he based in Arles (in modern-day France) or in Kent? The existence of an Archbishop implies a significant Christian population existing on British soil. This then brings more questions to mind.
It says """"That Christmas…"""". But what year is that?
The king became a saint after his death, but the sentence may be in the wrong place. Did the king die shortly after Augustine's arrival?
In the same paragraph, some information of the existence of Christians before Augustine's arrival is given. This info should go before the discussion of Augustine's arrival.
Mellitus and Justus are suddenly introduced without explanation.
The sentence """"A theory by the historian S. Brechter…"""" is either a run-on sentence or is incomplete.

Additional work
After the first sentence describing the two episcopal sees, there is a sudden jump to after 1066 and a discussion of a cathedral. How are they linked? Also what cathedral is it? The description of the archeology seems out of place in the """"Additional work"""" section. Is it meant to show that Augustine managed to build new churches?
If Aethelbert was only the King of Kent, how was he able to summon bishops outside his realm?
There is a sudden introduction of the tonsure.

Further success
Concerning """"temples and usages"""" is that """"temples and their use""""? The """"former… latter"""" construct does not work very well here.
Concerning the quote """"whoever wishes…"""", who said that?

I would recommend reading the article out loud. I think you will find some sentence structures that seem a bit complex or difficult to understand. Following the corrections, a good copyedit/prose check is needed. I give as an example, the sentence """"As to why Pope Gregory…"""" could be made better as in """"Nothing is mentioned in the sources on why Pope Gregory chose a monk to head the mission"""".

I hope this has been helpful.   """,0
