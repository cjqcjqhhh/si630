t3_n2frxp,ELI5: Why does riding a bicycle feel faster than being in a car?,gwj20yu,"Your body is much better at detecting changes in speed rather than your actual speed at a given point. When you’re in an enclosed car you are mostly isolated from the elements and the factors indicating acceleration are the movement of your surroundings and the sensation of being pushed and pulled by the seat as the car accelerates and decelerates. Once you’ve been rolling along at a relatively stable 50 MPH or so, it stops feeling “fast”. When you’re on an uninclosed bike, you have the constant feeling of wind rushing over your face and dragging on your body to remind you how fast you are moving, even if you are going comparatively slow. All that being said, this will to an extent be anecdotal and someone might disagree that being on a bicycle feels faster than a car.",779

t3_n365qz,Does any other woman feel like being feminine is something you had to grow into?,gwo0yj5,"I think the reason might be that nowadays society portraits feminity or feminine characters as weak and forces( I don't think that's a good word but I can't remember anything else to replace it) them to be more masculine. Feminity is great, having characters like nurturance, sensitivity, sweetness, supportiveness, gentleness, warmth, passivity, cooperativeness, expressiveness, modesty, humility, empathy, affection, tenderness, and being emotional, kind, helpful, devoted, and understanding is amazing. That's why the couples in which both the person involved only show once certain character than their relationship is unstable, I might be wrong I don't have any data to back it up.

t3_n3cmgx,ELI5 What makes some metals stronger than others?,gwpezlq,"Metal atoms are organized by arranging themselves into many repeated pieces called [unit cells](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/unit%20cell). Pure metals such as iron, gold, tin, and aluminum only have one type of atom in their unit cell structure. For example, a piece of aluminum foil is made up of tons of organized aluminum atoms. Metallic alloys, such as steel, brass, and bronze all have more than one type of element in their structures. For example, steel has a mostly iron structure with carbon atoms dispersed throughout. The different crystal structures of alloys and pure metals directly affect their physical properties, such as strength or hardness. For example, pure iron (a.k.a Ferrite) forms a [body-centered cubic](https://www.lff-group.com/posts/carbon-steel-fundamentals-part-1) (BCC) unit cell, a cube with an iron atom in the center and atoms at each corner. The unit cell of steel is called [face-centered cubic](https://www.lff-group.com/posts/carbon-steel-fundamentals-part-1) (FCC) with atoms on all corners as well as faces. Generally speaking, pure metals have BCC structures and alloys have FCC structures. The Bitesize webpage of the British Broadcasting Corporation states that alloys are [harder and stronger](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z8db7p3/revision/2) than pure metals because there are more atoms occupying the FCC structure than the BCC structure. As seen on Professor Marzari’s illustrations of unit cells in her MIT [lecture slides](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-012-fundamentals-of-materials-science-fall-2005/lecture-notes/lec16b_note.pdf), there are two total atoms in the BCC unit cell and four total atoms in the FCC unit cell. This difference in microstructures results in a “[greater force required \[to distort\] the layers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z8db7p3/revision/2)” of atoms in alloys than in elemental metals. In other words a higher concentration of atoms leads to a stronger material. This also explains why an elemental metal like titanium, [which has a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure](https://www.phase-trans.msm.cam.ac.uk/2004/titanium/titanium.html) (HCP) is so strong. HCP has a very tightly packed structure making it difficult to pull the atoms and move them around. There are many other factors that cause metals to be stronger than others, such as oxidation, temperature, and heat treatment, but the atomic structure is the most basic and important reason.",2501

You don't need an MFA, and the programs who do the selecting want one kind of fiction. In my writing group, the traditionally published writers with big book deals don't have MFAs, while the people with MFAs publish in respectable literary journals but can't even find agents. There was a thread in this subreddit about a woman who teaches creative writing (maybe at an MFA?) who has an agent but can't find a publisher for her literary novel. Her husband, meanwhile, has no degree, writes funky genre stuff, and has a multi-book deal. To me, that story summarizes how I feel about MFA programs.

It would also need to be able to change its code enough for it to no longer fit definitions released by anti-malware companies. It would also have to actually do something that would provide value to the attacker. Edit: also another interesting feature would be the ability to operate over different ports using legitimate protocols while spoofing the source IP/MAC. Basically being able to disguise its network traffic as legitimate traffic on a network from machines that have a valid reason to be sending that kind of traffic. That would make it really hard to stop it from working and spreading via traditional network security methods.,707

t3_n4h4y9,"ELI5: Why are some materials squishy, bendy, or more spesifically, malleable?",gwvktem,"There are many different specific reasons why a substance may be malleable. However, in general they all come to the ability for the atoms of that substance to move past each other without breaking the bond they have. One of the most interesting phenomena is the one you'll see in metals that can bend. We like to think of metals as one evenly spaced mass of atoms. However the truth is metals will form crystals within their structures. At the borders of these crystals there are bonds that are stretched and barely holding on. When you bend the metal, the force you are applying slides those crystals past one another, moving that stretched space along the mass of the metal until it reaches the edge. This is why if you bend a paperclip back and forth enough times you will snap it. You've accumulated enough of those stressed bonds at the edges that the mass can't hold together. Larger crystals in metal make less stressed bonds which makes that metal less malleable because the crystals can't slide past each other.",1021

t3_n4mini,"ELI5: If lipids have twice as much energy as carbohydrates, why is glucose used in respiration?",gwwnuv2,"Technically, what's used in respiration is a thing called an acetyl group, which is two carbon atoms with some extra bits. This is what is processed by the mitochondria into CO2, water and a bunch of energy, and the energy ""value"" of a calorific molecule is just a matter of how good that molecule is at providing acetyl groups. Lipids are long chains of carbon atoms. Every two carbon atoms can easily be snapped off and converted into an acetyl group and carried to the mitochondria. That's really efficient for storing energy, then. Glucose is 6 carbon atoms, but it can only make two acetyl groups due to the way the cell converts glucose. Comparing carbon atoms, glucose makes 4 ""useful"" carbon atoms out of 6, but lipids can make 4 useful carbon atoms out of 4, which is a much better ratio. The unique benefit of glucose is that some energy is also produced from anaerobic respiration. Glycolysis, the process of converting glucose to pyruvate (the step just before acetyl), releases a small amount of energy even before the mitochondria get involved, but it also uses up a limited resource called NAD. This NAD gets contaminated with hydrogen, and for glycolysis to continue, it needs to be cleaned. Fortunately, the mitochondria can take the hydrogen off the NAD and convert it into energy and water molecules. That's what's happening in aerobic respiration. Unfortunately, they need oxygen to do it, cos you can't make water out of just hydrogen. When oxygen isn't available, the body can still refresh NAD, but all the energy that was in the contaminating hydrogen gets lost, instead of converted into usable form. That's not ideal, but it's better than nothing, and glucose's ability to be better than nothing in poor conditions is really useful. Glucose is also the only thing that nerve cells use for fuel. We're not entirely sure why that is, but some good theories exist around things like glucose metabolism doing less damage to cells, being faster, and requiring less oxygen even when aerobic respiration is available (a lot of oxygen is burned in lipid -&gt; acetyl conversion).",2097

Got xrays and ct scans and within the next week I had 2 surgeries to fix it (late 2020) And my spine wasn't fused, I twisted several vertebrae, there were bone chunks free floating, and the rods were so loose they could jiggle.

t3_n6vlyl,ELI5: How does furniture polish work?,gx9rhmq,"Wood is naturally porous - like a sponge. Wood is sometimes treated with oil, but typically it's vanished. Wood is basically coated in something to make it shiny. This coating can be too many things: * The excretions of lac beetles is very traditional (shellac, lacquer) - this is also used on many candies to make it shiny. * Nitrocellulose was popular in the early 1900s * Urethane or acrylic plastic is common today * Linseed oil is sometimes used * Natural waxes like beeswax, or synthetic wax from crude oil can also be used * Natural resins like amber, copal, and mastic can be used * Epoxy resins are used for extra durability The actual polish typically contains an oil or wax - when you rub this on it leaves a residue that makes it shiny. Some polishes can contain acids (vinegar, lemon, or synthetic ones), or solvents that can dissolve or thin some of the original finishes. Sometimes this can make it shinier, remove scratches, etc - but it can also weaken and degrade the finish. I would typically recommend a wax - like a paste finishing wax. These don't remove or damage the old finish, you're just adding something on top to make it shiny. If it's in bad shape - gel paint stripper to remove the old finish and a can or spray bottle of polyurethane will give it a good maintenance free finish that will last for many years.",1340

So, to port the old game you can (1) Translate each individual game to run on new hardware or (2) Pretend to be the old hardware. Obviously, if you plan on porting more than one game, option 2 is better because it's reusable, and that's what the Switch is doing. So the Switch hardware isn't just running the game, it's also running a software version of the entire SNES itself. The Switch's emulator also adds a rewind feature, which basically means it has to save the entire game state every second. Also, there could be inefficiencies in the design of the SNES itself that have to also be emulated in order to avoid breaking games. There could also be inefficiencies in the code of the game too. Normally, fast enough hardware would make those inefficiencies completely unnoticeable. But a lot of games were written specifically with the original hardware in mind, including the speed. So the emulator actually has to purposely run at the slower, original speed to preserve the intended speed of the game.",1067

t3_n7ide1,ELI5: how are pop songs with single artists made?,gxd03bp,"I'm not an expert in this but I had to learn about it in a music class a while ago. Basically a LOT of it depends on the artist. There are ghost writers and other people that will write songs and sell them off to an artist or record company in which case the artist is usually just doing vocals/playing an instrument. However there is a bit of controversy about doing that kind of thing in some communities and instead musical artists are often expected to do everything on their own with maybe some help from a producer. If they have help from a producer then the artist is usually the one singing/playing an instrument while a producer would go in and put it all together, mix it, and/or add in some more beats. Overall, it really just depends on the artist and even their contract with a music record (if they have one) as they can also have some influence over what an artist creates.",888

t3_n819uo,"Taking advantage of other people’s ignorance is malevolent, is it not?",gxgoxi9,"I think you could phrase your question a little differently to get better answers. ""Taking advantage"" implies they are being abusive and shuts down the conversation. I think a better way to put it would be ""Is using someone's ignorance to get them to do something always malevolent"". Well, that's basically parenting. You're ordering a human around under the assumption that your experience is better for it because of their ignorance. I'd say that a line is crossed if you have an opportunity to give the human information that would allow them to make their own choice, but instead you withhold some information, and only provide the information that you feel will lead them to make the decision you feel is right. So essentially you're manipulating someone to make a specific choice instead of giving them the tools to make their own choice. I can provide an example. I had someone close to me whose car engine died. They didn't know much about cars and asked me for my help. My mechanic told me they could put in a new engine, but that it was basically the same price as buying a newer car of equal value. I personally, and my mechanic felt that buying a new engine was a waste of money. However, I gave the owner of the car their options. I gave my recommendation, but I didn't tell them that was their only option. They chose to replace the engine. If I had told them they needed a new car, that would have been manipulative and wrong. Also, it may have been the right choice for them. While I'm completely capable of shopping for a new car, they knew so little about cars, they may have gotten ripped off, and were more comfortable knowing a trusted mechanic would fix the car. So the ""right"" decision for you, isn't always the right decision for another person.",1769

t3_n8fvbf,Are logical deductions more true than inferences from empirical observations?,gxjn7h3,"I think you correctly identify the weaknesses of the kind of 'everyday reasoning' you describe and the kind of 'logical deduction' you described, but they represent two extremes on a continuum. So, really, the contrast between 'inference from observation' and 'logical deduction from premises' is too quick. For instance, we can make inferences from observation about premises that are then used in logical deduction about stuff we haven't observed yet. This is how Einstein deduced that during a solar eclipse we will be able to observe stars that really are behind the sun, because the sun will bend the light coming from the stars and so that it will kind of curve around it. Later Eddington observed that this is what actually happens. That is what the hypothetico-deductive method is all about. So, in a way we can use deduction to figure out what must be true given that the premises are true, but deduction can't really be used to tell us which premises are true. Observations can give us leads about the truth of the premises, but (as you point out) they can also lead us wrong. Another thing that is important to take into account is that it makes quite a difference what it is you are trying to figure out. In questions to do with abstract entities such as you find in mathematics, geometry, and formal logic (where you don't rely on observation at all), then there you sometimes can seem to find axioms that are self-evidently true (neither true by observation nor deduction). Euclidean geometry is built on 5 self-evident axioms (there are complications with one of them, but lets ignore that here) like 'the shortest path between two points is a straight line, etc. Given their truth we can deductively infer a lot in an a priori fashion. Point is, deductive reasoning seems to work pretty well for figuring out such abstract truths, but for figuring out stuff about physical reality it seems we have to rely on observation. We can however still use deduction there too, but it becomes more uncertain since we seem not to be able to determine any self-evident premises.",2082

t3_n8hdzn,"ELI5: Why do when rockets re-enters the atmosphere from space get burn up, but rockets that is going to space don't?",gxih0p0,"Rockets leaving the Earth aren't actually travelling all that fast while they are still within the dense part of the atmosphere. In order to achieve orbit, a rocket is shot straight up initially in order to get through the densest air that is the source of a lot of drag, but then they are pitched over so that they are eventually travelling sideways, parallel to the Earth's surface. They continue to accelerate for a long part of that manouver, because objects in orbit are basically falling just like anything else would - it's just that they are travelling so far horizontally during their fall that the Earth's surface curves away from the object at the same rate that the object is falling toward the Earth, resulting in net zero altitude difference. An object in orbit is simply just travelling sideways really, really fast. In order to slow down a spacecraft from orbital velocity, theoretically you could turn to face the opposite direction and thrust for the same amount of time to get back to zero horizontal velocity, but this would be extremely expensive in terms of fuel consumption and the upstream effects on rocket design to carry all that fuel and get it up to orbit in the first place. Instead, rockets make use of the atmosphere to slow them down. A short initial burn in the direction opposite of travel is used initially to cause the spacecraft to fall out of orbit, but then aerodynamic braking in the atmospheric air is actually used to take off most of the speed. The thing is, a deorbiting spacecraft is travelling so fast that air simply can't move out of the way fast enough, so instead it compresses in front of the advancing spacecraft, forming a shockwave some distance in front of the physical hull surface. This adiabatic compression generates an immense amount of heat that the spacecraft must be protected from, which is what heat shielding tiles are for. The attitude of the reentering spacecraft is controlled, and the shielding oriented properly during the reentry to protect the vehicle until it slows down sufficiently to land or deploy a parachute. If the vehicle is not controlled or sufficiently protected from the reentry heat, it burns up.",2184

When I got married, never once a bird make its nest or have I put a cross above our front door and since that time; bad things kept happening.

We know which way the continents are currently moving (and how fast) so we can basically reverse the movement we see to show where they previously were. This also couples with the shapes of the continents - when the shapes broadly correspond it is a good sign that that is how they were previously joined. We can also be a bit more scientific and compare the rock formations we see - our maps show roughly which bits were attached to which bits, and we can quite easily investigate the rock types and formations found at these points to see how they compare. Where they match closely it is a good hint that they were once part of the same landmass and split. You can also do the same with things like fossils - the same as nowadays, certain species lived in certain areas, so matching fossil types at opposite sides of the ocean are another marker to show they were connected.",918

Nice thing about the pad is that there are mudrooms on entrances, and two doors between you and flesh eating zombies is better than one. I can pop a skylight and access the roof from my bedroom. The roof is entirely unavailable to zed although there is nowhere to go when you are up there and it is very steep, so you're basically hoping for helicopter rescue if it gets to that point.

I was older than 6 and I was adopted with two older biological siblings, one of whom was a teenager. Let me just state to anyone thinking about or in the process of doing this: Just because you chose to be their parent does not mean they have to chose to be your child. They will not bond to you immediately like a biological parent, they will always feel more connected to the idea of a birth parent or an actual birth parent. They might eventually love you more, sure, but they will always wonder and feel a sense of worthlessness or brokenness. ""Why didn't my parents love me enough?"" Also, so many adoptive parents that I have met and heard about that have horrible egos. They think they are a saint and deserve and endless supply of love and gratitude from their child(ren) for choosing to adopt. The child you adopt will never, ever be perfect. They will never be grateful all of the time, and they shouldn't have to be. Again, they didn't chose you. So many parents adopt in order to fulfill their idea of a perfect family. While adopting is a wonderful thing to do and can be so fulfilling, it requires a lot of patience and understanding. And few to no expectations.

t3_n9smnv,ELI5: What Causes JPEG Compression?,gxpk1y0,"Storing every pixel as a separate data point gets *really* expensive real fast when you're dealing with images consisting of millions of pixels. That's why compression formats exist. The two main types are lossless (which conserve all the data so a picture can be exactly reproduced) and lossy, which make sacrifices and remove some data in order to reduce the file size. For example, jpeg groups an area that's approximately the same color into one big square and writes the information of 50 pixels as only one or two large pixels. If you do this once it saves a ton of storage space and since our eyes don't actually perceive pixels the same way as a computer does, the image still looks nearly identical. If you do this many times however, you end up with multiple passes of an algorithm that compound the mistakes and approximations of the previous pass. Kind of like the telephone game that we played in kindergarten, each pass loses a bit more information. The best way to avoid it is to share the original image instead of compressing it again. Don't take a screenshot, but instead directly download the image for example. That way the compression is already written in the image and your phone doesn't need to do it again. Edit: jpeg does a lot more than just that obviously, but that's the most prominent feature that gives it that blocky look",1353

It's still worth playing but it's a poor substitute for Skyrim. Still my favorite though even though it's almost 20 years old now is Morrowind because you really have to pay attention to the story and missions.

Budgeting and finances route, you can either go cheap until they can afford to buy a better car for themselves, and if they dent or ding the car, it’s not a big problem. If you get a new car, there is more safety features, better tech, crumple zones, and driver safety features and ergonomics, at the cost of spending more money, and maybe being a bit more stressed if the vehicle is damaged or wrecked. With statistics; there is a couple stipulations... Usually, a high percentage of new/young drivers have a moderate to high risk of getting into a high speed accident, and a high to extreme risk of getting into a minor accident (distracted and fatigued driving is the most commonly known cause), so you take and apply that statistic, to the new driver(s) skillset and safe handling of a vehicle, and make a decision about wether to buy a newer or older vehicle, depending on what their risk factor is at, and how much you are able to spend in those cases.

Something like this: 0.5mm diameter cubic nanites (which take up a volume of 0.5^(3) = 0.125mm^(3)) . 2m^(2) body area (estimated from 6ft tall at 180lbs) and 2mm thickness ( like a thick coin ). 2m^(2) is 2,000,000mm^(2) and so the volume of the suit would be 4,000,000mm^(3). Divided by the nanite volume (0.125mm^(3)) would result in 32,000,000 nanites. If you halve the nanite diameter then it'll be 8 times as many (since the volume is the diameter^(3)). If you halve the suit thickness then it'll be half as many. Either way the numbers are in the tens to hundreds of millions.

This creates a dissonance within him that drives him to dedicate whatever time and energy he can spare into understanding what makes humans human, often surprising the actual humans around him with the naked insight he provides concerning the things they do and feel. For much of the series, Data is emotionless, serious, and fairly unknowledgeable; but because of the perspective he offers and the childlike innocence he has, he is one of the most beloved characters in the entire Star Trek franchise.

t3_naubwu,"ELI5: Why does hot coffee that goes cold taste bad, but iced coffee or cold brew taste fine?",gxx4yp0,"long time specialty coffee barista here. ""specialty coffee"" is used to denote high-quality beans that are sourced directly from farms, not bought on the commodity markets. the roasters we worked with were extremely dedicated, and the product was often very different than what most people are accustomed to. a light-roasted high quality coffee should have a color like tea, a clean body (not thick!!!!!!!!), and a juicy, flavorful, sweet flavor. good coffee is truly more like tea than the coffee you'd get at starbucks or dunkin donuts, to the point that those latter drinks are almost unrecognizable as coffee to me. here's my point. if you're drinking GOOD coffee, it tests *best* at lower temperatures, somewhere between hot and room temperature when the flavors have had time to develop and it reaches a temperature that won't scald your taste buds. it will continue to taste good as it turns lukewarm and cool. so if your coffee tastes bad when it's cooler, it was never good coffee to begin with. as such, i cannot really answer your question, as the premise of the question (""hot coffee that goes cold taste\[s\] bad"") is itself flawed. but i'll try to answer somewhat. iced coffee that you get at many shops is simply yesterday's brewed coffee poured over ice. if that tastes good to you, then that's great, i'm jealous! at best, it's tolerable to me. i make no apologies for being a snob so save your breath if you want to call me out on it. cold brew makes good coffee because for whatever reason the low temperatures never extract some of the harsher notes from even low-quality coffee. i suspect that most places are doing a better job at filtering cold brew, because partly why warm coffee that goes cold tastes bad is due to unfiltered solids continuing to brew, leaving bitter/sour tastes.",1805

t3_nay8vn,ELI5 why there is a gas shortage in the eastern US?,gxwcxt3,"The gas pipelines are controlled by computers. The people working at the sites use computers all the time for various things. All the sensor data is collected to computers. I have not seen any detailed information about exactly what they are doing and why they have to shut down the pipeline. However it is likely a precautionary measure. It is not unusual to take all computers offline after such an attack in order to scan them for any hidden software. If you leave some computers on it is possible that the malicious software might be able to copy itself between the computers and you may never get rid of it or even detect it. They are able to shut off the pipelines during this work because they know that the gas stations have enough gas in stock to delay the delivery for a few days under normal circumstances. New fuel deliveries are scheduled as normal at the end of this week. But just to make sure they did not go dry many gas stations increased their prices a bit which is an effective way of driving customers away or at least get them to wait until the end of the week to fill up their tanks again. The biggest concern is truckers, ships and airliners who are the big consumers of fuel and are therefore actively checking fuel prices everywhere and are able to change their plans to add fuel stops outside the effected area. However this backfired big time. People knew the fuel pipeline had shut down but did not know for how long and they saw the fuel prices starting to go up. So instead of running their fuel tanks a bit drier then normal a few enterprising people hoped to make a lot of money buy buying all the fuel that the gas stations had and selling them for highly inflated prices. So all the fuel that was supposed to be available at gas stations for people who could not wait until next week to fill their trucks is now locked away in crazy peoples garages. And as if people did not learn from the big toiletpaper hording last year gas stations will not take the gas back.

Even [iron burns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuUykfSzdgY) if oxygen can get at it efficiently enough.

The physics comes in handy when thinking about units, spectral content of light, light and surface interactions, things like that. As far as on the job stuff, thats a huge part of day to day. I had to teach myself solidworks, as well as alot of the structure of the company. Like how to utilize all the members of the company effectively to get tasks done. It's a small company and it's very self managed. You have to ask for help when you need it. Like I'm not great at electronics, or if the programming gets tough it's not practical to tackle it myself. Those things they struggle to teach in school.

t3_nc5suf,How is Clark Kent ripped?,gy4ghlb,"Why is a Tiger in a zoo ripped? Look at them, they are all solid muscle with not much fat on them unless they really work at it. The trick is for tigers, their natural state is to be muscled up and they don't really need to exercise to get to a much higher level of fitness than a human being does. So Kryptonians are like that. Clark, on a proper diet, basically fills out to full muscle mass. In some comics he actually swells slightly if you put him in a suit so Ma Kent had to be careful when buying clothes for him. Because he is naturally in a muscled state, he doesn't need to work out like a conventional human would. Basically, he has a genetic switch flipped that has his muscles build up mass whenever possible. The reason we aren't like this is because evolution figured out that's terrible for long term survival. Keeping up large amounts of unnecessary muscle mass means our ancestors needed a bunch of extra calories and those calories were in short supply. Occassionally you see a human with that switch flipped and then you get kids like Kyle Kane or Richard Sandrak, and if you read up on them they are just like that.

t3_nc7wqu,ELI5: Why does colours seem so much less vibrant after sleeping in the sun?,gy43ki1,"I would guess it has something to do with the pupillary light reflex. The pupil restricts in bright light to allow less light in so it’s easier to see contrast in bright light. Conversely, the pupil opens up in darkness to allow more light in. Additionally, the rods and cones that are what detect the light entering the eye. As the ambient brightness increases,they grow less sensitive and in darkness, they are more sensitive. Simply put, this is because as the light level increases, the rods and cones will send a weaker signal to the brain telling you that they just detected a particle of light. You may notice it takes about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the darkness when going from a brightly lit area to outside at night. These are evolutionary adaptions that allow humans to see well in varying levels of ambient light.",838
t3_ncj391,How do you properly deal with a loss of a pet?,gy5am89,"Physically I think similarly to any other lost loved one and to whatever extent helps you emotionally to start the honouring and grieving process.

If you think about it people who are really close to their pets have a very deep connection. There is often more physical contact than there is with human loved ones. There is also a bond built in learning how to communicate without the language and communication styles that we're used to. All of this requires significant attention and connection and for many people, especially those who are emotionally sensitive (which I personally think is a strength) a very rich relationship forms. Overall: Breathe, allow feelings to surface, go through the stages of grief and know that you were both better for knowing each other. I hope this helps.",931

I went full tilt when I wrote it. Now, it's important to note that I had a strong sense of the main character before I even started. I wrote down some bullet point notes, character names, name of the city, setting, and that's about it. From there, I set out a small goal for my character. Step 1 (chapter 1) start his first day as a detective. That was it. I had absolutely no idea where the story was going. I just knew what the first step was. From that first chapter and the events that unfolded within, I figured out the next chapter, and then the next, and the next. What really helped me to stay focused throughout the entire writing process was thematically appropriate background music. I listened to Jazz Noir. My novel series is based on a detective in a noir-ish era fantasy city. That music kept my head in the theme and in the story. I just finished writing book 2 and it's currently going through beta readers. That book was also written with that same music in my ears. Seeing as how I've gone and turned myself into a mystery / crime novelist, I have now set out the goal of building each novel around a case.

Naturally, as a stan that actually thinks they're human. I told my other fellow stans that it's great that the member found someone if it's true but if it's not then it's fine either way. Of course, this online friend just goes ballistic and screams about how the member isn't allowed to date because that's cheating and that's not how things are supposed to be. Then, they sent pics of self-harm and blood and said that they cannot accept the fact that the member is possibly dating that and stuff. After that, they sent pics of their own posters and merchandise covered in their own blood and they told us to do the same in protest. Obviously we kicked them out of our group chat. I never knew what happened to them but last time I checked their account, it was deactivated or it didn't show up on the search bar anymore. Stan - just to clarify about the word ""Stan"", it doesn't stand for stalker-fan. It stands for fans or at least,that's what our definition of a stan is.

There were no people around, just one house around 100-200 meters away, so I thought I'd stop and just go into the tall grass on the side of the road and do my thing there. So I went in, started looking for a place to do it, and almost got into it when I suddenly heard shouting. Then I see an old guy running towards me from the house, shouting in some language I don't understand, and looking angry. So I come back to the road, put the toilet paper away, try to talk to him - with no success at all, as he didn't speak any of the languages I spoke, and I didn't speak Croation/Bosnian.

As we walked around we both heard talking in a low tone from 20 yards then a computer for the printer had started printing out labels while my coworker on the other side was saying that he heard the locks on the trailer doors softly knocking against the doors. We ended up meeting in the middle on the other side neither of us seen anyone and were slightly freaked out at the time.

t3_ne2lmg,How do I have fun writing by myself?,gyegdqx,"As an avid roleplayer, I've done a lot of ~collaborative writing~ in my time. I guess I'll chime in. I totally understand where you're coming from, because there tends to be an unpredictable aspect to not being in control of one (r more) characters in a scene. You can then bounce off the energy one another brings and when it's good, you and your writing partner are drumming up what feels like a really awesome story. However, alone you don't got that bouncing back and forth. You're the only one in charge of where the scene goes. When you're trying to write out an interaction it feels flat since you're in control of both sides. I've done both solo and collaborative writing. I would say my solo work is totally different than what I write with other people, it's kind of hard to replicate. What I can say is what I've found that helps that bounce is writing all my dialogue out first, maybe a few lines of action if needed to give a sketch of the scene. What could also help is try and write as if you are you and your writing partner. Write a block from one character's pov, actions, dialogue and then respond to it from the other character's. And then you can go through and fix things up, flesh things out, fix the POV to whatever format you're intending to complete the story in. Just an idea! I hope you figure out a way to enjoyably write solo. I understand how difficult it is when you're used to collaborating with someone else (I often called it 'junk food' writing since it can get so addictive but never really satisfied my own writing goals)",1559

So I would suggest sitting them down ""irl or over an online call"" and just taking it slow and asking them to hear you out. Hear out the whole thing. Asking them to give you a moment of their time and respect that you deserve. and just honestly and bluntly saying hey guys. this is the situation. Imagine if this happened to you and the guy who cheated with your wife showed up. I wouldn't do this to you. Furthermore I dont appreciate being told I'm overreacting when this is clearly affecting me negatively after the partner of 18 years betrayed me like this. I would really appreciate some support that I myself would provide at the drop of a hat...etc etc. Don't press them because I know some people can get defensive really quickly.

It used to be the case that, due to very limited options for travel and communication, people tended to marry within their village/town/city. Since this is no longer the case, and since many people relocate to different cities or countries now, changing romantic partners is more common. Third, there exists in every culture a standard of beauty which most people, subconsciously or not, hold as the ideal within that culture, if not the world at large.

If you had a drink that was 70 degrees inside a room where the air was 70 degrees they would both just stay 70 degrees. If the drink was hotter than the air it would it would transfer its heat to the air and become cooler. If the drink was colder than the air, the air would transfer it's heat to the drink and the drink would become warmer. If you could suck all the air out of a room the drink would just stay the same temperature since nothing is taking it's heat away or adding to it (not entirely true). A lot of mugs actually have an inner wall and outer wall with a vacuum in-between to create this effect. Now obviously the inner wall is connected to the outer wall at some point to hold the mug together. Additionally things will radiate heat even if they're not coming into direct contact with anything. So mugs won't keep things hot (or cold) forever, but it can last a while.",961

t3_ngeyjh,viltrumites physicology. I'm really confused on something's?,gyqlxl7,"No idea on 1. On 2, basically the Viltrumite genes are almost all dominant. So mark has a bunch of human genes, but they act like recessive genes - garbage information that ends up not being used by cells as blueprints to build his physiology. An example of how this works in humans is right handedness. Breed a left handed human with a right handed human and the resulting offspring will be 85-90% right handed. His cells have human information coded in their DNA but it's not expressed. Expression being key here - mark was human until he hit a certain age, then bam, viltrumite genes kick in and his physiology changes. That's why no matter what you breed viltrumites with, the children will reach maturity then take a hard turn to viltrumite - when they do, at all. Nolan did say he was waiting for mark to develop powers OR NOT. That was always a chance. Because Mark is not pure viltrumite, he will not live as long as Nolan. But half if infinity is still infinity. Purebred viltrumites live for many thousands of years. How many thousands? We don't know. We do know the guy that fathered one person who was already much older than Nolan, the guy that originated the Viltrumite empire, was still alive in the present, so make of that what you will.",1254
t3_ngfqci,What is a general advice for broke days for a family?,gyqq4if,"Don’t beat yourself up for not being able to provide a “better” meal or anything really. Having the bare minimum is so much better than having nothing. I grew up poor AF but never really knew it because even though we were eating hotdogs and rice or spaghetti everyday I had something to eat when my friends didn’t. Hold on to hope and treat every day’s meal as a gift. Any kind of chicken casserole is dope in my book (boxed or made from scratch, frozen veggies are cheaper and healthier that canned stuff usually, eggs can feed you for any meal anytime, breakfast for dinner can be fun instead of necessary, try to plan out a menu for the week and do your shopping in one trip instead of multiple trips (this saves me hella money). Also water is really filling after a small meal and can keep you feeling satisfied for a lot longer so make sure you’re hydrating after eating! For fun we would go on walks, go to the park with pbj’s, go to the bookstore or library, walk around the mall with a tiny budget for an item or two, cloud watch, arts and crafts like making a collage with magazines and glue, make cooking a family affair, share and do self care things like grooming/laundry/nails/face care, cheap squirt guns are hours of fun from the dollar store, participate in community events like going to a farmers market (tasty samples), youth volunteers usually take parents for their programs and sometimes they even have snacks depending on the program.

t3_nggwzw,"Eli5 What is meant by shorting a stock? How can somebody ""borrow"" shares?",gyqw3q0,"Remember Wimpy, from Popeye, and his ""I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger to-day""? It's really a lot like that. Normally when you sell or buy stock, the exchange of money for stock happens at approx. the same time. Shorting stock is almost always referring to ""selling short"", which is, literally, ""I will give you this many stock shares at future time T, if you give me _now_ what they're worth now"". With the presumption that the price will go DOWN before T, so that you can buy that many shares just in time, paying less than you already got from selling them. This gets you in trouble if the price, instead, goes UP, and you don't already have enough shares to pass on ... and, since there's technically no limit on HOW high a stock's price can go, you may end up in REAL trouble if you find either that you now can't afford to buy enough shares ... or if there AREN'T enough shares available to buy, at any price, because others are holding on to theirs to see how high it'll go. ""Buying short"" and ""buying/selling long"" also exist, with appropriate differences between time money changes hands and time stocks transfer. But those three don't run the same risks, if you analyze them. --Dave, and computerized millisecond-timing stock-trading agents make this all GREATLY difficult for single unassisted people to make money off of, unless things happen that defy the predicting models, like the recent reddit/Gamestop foofaraw.",1442

t3_nh2jdd,Are fake ghosts too ScoobyDoo?,gytx13v,"It comes off as more campy, it’s often treated as a trope for kids shows, but I don’t think it’s wrong to use the idea. And if we avoided common tropes that showed up in books or TV shows, there would be nothing we could really write about. Science-fiction couldn’t use Warriors space races because we’ve seen them with Klingons, Fantasy couldn’t use the elegant elf or the stoic dwarf. The femme fatales of mystery would be no more. We should avoid using tired tropes the same way they’ve always been used, the reader just stops caring after a while and it loses its original meaning, the same way that certain figures of speech have kind of lost their unique edge. However, just because Scooby Doo did it, doesn’t mean it can’t be done and done so in a unique way that readers enjoy. My worry would be less so about the tropes and more so about your personal doubt of the story. If you doubt the story as the author, my fear would be some of that doubt seeping in to the story itself. If you feel the story doesn’t work for some reason, you need to look at your world and figure out if it plays buy a set of rules that you can understand and make sense. I think there’s a good chance you’re just being hard on yourself because you don’t want this to be compared to Scooby Doo and this is something we saw a lot growing up, but I personally think the idea can work if you handle it correctly. Scooby Doo treated it as a child’s cartoon, you were the potential of treating it as something a little more grown-up and therefore it’s different enough that I don’t think there’s much of a problem.",1593

The simple answer is the analog of water passing in a pipe. Just as the water in a pipe goes 1 part of water (cross-section area) in series at a time if you watched closely. The simple difference of x16 vs. x1 is that you have a pipe with 16x the diameter vs. ""1x"" or ""normal"" diameter. Similar to how a fire hydrant is a very wide pipe, but a bathroom sink is a narrow pipe. Pipes allow water to flow in a straight line, with varying widths. Why is this useful? Some PCIe uses are for graphics cards that need that x16 diameter pipe to display your mind-blowing videos. Some use cases are just a slow wifi adapter that can use x2 or x4 because the pipe requirements don't need as much ""water"" or ""information"" all at once. Getting deeper, PCIe was invented for flexible use cases that were unforeseen at creation. They allowed a way for future uses to continue with the same interface for ease of computer design re-use (i.e. processor design re-use). Yes, it is a ""serial interface"" - but it's actually complex and using all those pins in parallel too. It's actually a configurable set of ""serial interfaces"" in ""parallel configuration"". If you need to know the details of a serial interface, it simply means that the data contains the clock embedded in the data signal itself. There is a ""PCIe Clock"" signal, but that isn't for data collection, just coordination at the low-level and proper reference alignment to ensure the 2x processors that are talking to each other know what is going on.

t3_nijch2,What is the difference between mathematics and metaphysics in Kant?,gz2flbb,"Kant's rejection of metaphysics as science comes from his distinction between the phenomenal and the noumenal. The noumenal is the ""truest"" reality, or that which exists independent of the mind. By virtue of existing independent of the mind, it is impossible to know anything about the noumenal world. So, questions of God or of reality that go beyond the purview of our experience can never be proven either way. Kant does, however, argue that metaphysics has a purpose in the phenomenal world (the world that we **do** experience. The phenomenal is dictated by what **synthetic a priori functions.** These are the faculties of intuition, understanding, and reason. According to Kant, these faculties exist in every rational being. Because of this, it is actually possible to make demonstrative claims about the phenomenal world. So, metaphysics is much better as a **critical philosophy.** It's better at teaching us what we don't know, rather than what we do know. Mathematics (because it is found through reason, intuition, understanding) is possible as a science in the phenomenal world. It operates within a constant set of principles; principles necessary to the phenomenal world. Metaphysics as a science is impossible because it's trying to make claims about the noumenal world, which is impossible. Simply put, mathematics is possible because it operates solely in the phenomenal world and is consistent with synthetic a priori concepts. *\*Edit: I should qualify this by saying that I am by no means an expert on Kant, although I have read Critique of Pure Reason and the Prolegomena.*",1596

The debt was issued in good faith and if every bit of debt was cancelled, there would be more faith in currency. Think of it like this. You work to earn money. If someone asks to borrow money from you with the promise of paying you back, you say Here you go, you just pay me back monthly. But I’m not talking about pennies. I talking half of your yearly paycheck. What would happen if they decided to not pay you back at all? You would go on but at a drastic different lifestyle considering you have lost a lot of income. Eventually you will make enough to recover but what if you lost your job in the mean time? Or got in a bad accident? The rest of your bills would start piling up and you might not be able to pay your bills and have to cancel your debt with bankruptcy..... See how that snowballed? That is what would happen if all public debt just went away.... Everyone that expected to be paid wouldn’t and then they would be able to pay their bills and so on and so on.

That being said, there are some feelings that I had 10 years ago that still ring true, especially with the new experiences that I've had. Some things just stay solid.

t3_nj1s2g,"I’ve never been on a plane, and barely been inside an airport, but now I am about to start flying at least every 6-8 weeks. Is there anything I should know?",gz4zahd,"Well done for doing something new like this OP. If you’re travelling with big bags, you’ll be dropping them off first. They’ll weigh them at the baggage counter (usually well signposted or close to the doors) and away they go. Then you’ll go through security. This is just where they’ll check your smaller suitcase, make you go through a metal detector (or scanner) and assess whether or not they need to test anything for anything. A lot of the time, you have to take large electronics out of your suitcase and put them on a tray on their own. You won’t be able to take large liquids through and all of your small liquids should be in a clear plastic bag out of your suitcase. You might get patted down after you go through the metal detector, you might not. Once all is well, you go down a very clever path that usually takes you past shops and places to eat, depending on the size of the airport. Your gate should be clearly signposted so that you know where you’re going, but people will be happy to help if you ask. You usually show your passport before boarding if you’re flying international and you should have your boarding pass ready. You board the plane, pop your small case in an overhead locker, any smaller bags can usually go under the seat in front of you. Keep your tray up where it is for takeoff. Usually the people working onboard will do a safety demonstration as the plane is being taxied to the runway. This is all normal and something done on every flight. The setting off can be a little fast on the ground, especially if the runway is bumpy. But, it’s usually over and done very quickly because the plane is much smoother as it lifts, it then doesn’t feel quite so fast. There can occasionally be a lot of turbulence when taking off so I would expect some shaking just to be safe. Sometimes it can be bumpy. Up at altitude, it’s often much smoother with pockets of turbulence. Try not to let these worry you. I’m terrified of flying and a travel blogger so I completely understand if they do, but nothing bad will happen because of them and pilots will often talk to each other about bad pockets to try avoid them. Good luck OP, I’m sure everything will go fine!",2188

Sometimes I’ll think about what is I want to write next in my story, so it’ll be more developed. Sometimes I’ll write outlines of a story I want to work on. Other times, I’m doing research for a story. I’ll even spend development days just reading other works so I can look at how other people write and the techniques they use, so I can add those tools to my writer’s toolbox. I think having days where I don’t write but instead think about writing is very helpful to me, because it takes the pressure off me to not constantly write.

Besides, if you work with one of these programs you quickly realise there's no way to fix everything they flag, and they're not telling you to either.

t3_nj3wqi,[Harry Potter] Why was Slytherin house not discontinued after Salazar left the school and was kinda sorta evil?,gz697sj,"I think the way Slytherin house was portrayed in the books was quite thin. I always got the impression the house was meant to be for those who possess cunning and therefore are not inherently evil. That said, that's just my head cannon. Another head cannon explanation that is actually supported by the books (although Chamber of Secrets contradicts it) is that students are sorted in to houses based on their most prominent character trait, e.g Gryffindors are courageous. If they were to remove Slytherin, it could potentially exclude hundreds of students who don't fit the requirements of the other three houses. Then again, if this is true, you have to wonder if there are other potential students going uneducated because they don't fit with the 4 main houses.

t3_njnmvz,What is happening when you’re loading a new browser window on your phone and it refreshes a bunch of times?,gz8ery9,"This is probably due to buffering. Buffering in few words is your computer receiving and processing data from servers so you can visualize the web pages in your screen. Obviously the server will be sending and receiving the data from your computer so it will need to refresh over and over again until you computer have processed all the information needed to let you visualize the webpage. (it will need to refresh because pages are static, they cannot change in real time but they can get updates, when the page updates it will need to refresh to show you the actual thing.) That's also the reason why slower connections means slower loading times, your computer needs to download all the data before showing you the page. Just like you would download anything. Like, you cannot play a song without having it saved somewhere. You need to download it first and then you can listen to it. Is exactly the same thing with pages. The only difference is that when you make a change (send data) in the page or the page needs to show additional information (receive data), it will need to download more data and refresh the page.",1122

There do exist programs called decompilers, which can go the other direction and give you source code from a piece of machine code.

I didn’t get to it until the evening, and some fuckwit decided they were gonna use the whole tank and then leave it. At this time of the evening the technical staff who have access to more tanks and stuff like it had long since gone home so I couldn’t get a new one, and I couldn’t leave my sample either, cus if they didn’t get evaporated and reconstituted, then they’d expire. I could not let this happen, those samples were taken at a specific date I’d outlined in my methodology, and I only had the ones I’d grabbed on that day. So I needed a solution really quick with whatever the lab had to hand. This was for me to set the samples in some test tubes, precariously balance them in a beaker, and put that beaker in a heat bath. After about half an hour of me staring intently at the bath, to see if the samples had f i n a l l y evaporated, and to make sure they didn’t fall over and lose my samples forever, they actually did evaporate.

t3_nk990a,ELI5 What is a logarithmic scale? Why is it more useful for some things than a regular numerical scale?,gzbng1b,"Imagine you wanted to plot the net worth of people in your area in a graph that shows all the data. Now most of the net worth will be around the lower end with some higher in between. So you can nicely see how the worth is distributed among the people. Then suddenly Elon Musk decides to join your area. Now your nice graph is screwed. Why is it screwed? Because the number line that previously was at let's say 500k max suddenly jumped to 147 billion. So the graph, as it is supposed to show all points, now is squished such that Elon Musk is at the top, a single outlier in the whole distribution. Even the richest guy in your area before is a measly 0.00034% on the scale. (Yes that's right, those are 3 zeros after the decimal AND it's percent. That is how laughable 500k are in that distribution) This makes it impossible to see any difference between the 500k guy and the 300k guy the 30k guy and so on. They're all down in the same line from Elons perspective. So now you take a logarithmic scale, meaning you take their net worth, throw it into a logarithmic function and then plot that value. You obviously have to adjust the y axis accordingly. The 30k guy is now a 4.47. The 200k guy is now a 5.3. The 500k guy is now a 5.7. And Elon? Well he's an 11.17. These now fit on a single graph and you can still make out differences between the ""smaller"" numbers. Logarithmic scales are generally often used when exponential growth is concerned, like population growth, spreading of diseases. Also when you have to work with data that spans a huge range of values, like comparing the size of objects in the universe. Using logarithmic scales and transformations is very common in machine learning and data science.",1718

And finally, if you had the choice, would you want different parents?",gzcc59m,"My mother is autistic, she's in her 70s and was diagnosed as an adult as it wasn't really a thing when she was a child. Her behaviour caused my father to leave when I was very young, leaving her raising 3 kids alone. She doesn't really understand jokes or sarcasm, so you have to be careful how you phrase things as she'll take most things literally. Any change to routine is a struggle, which meant I always had very strict rules about where I could go, how long I could stay out for etc. For example, if I was visiting a friend, I couldn't call her and ask to sleep over, as that wasn't The Plan. My friends always thought she was great; she always fed people, made a big fuss on birthdays etc, but it was because she had taught herself certain social cues and expectations. When it was just family she was completely different and usually closed off. She also doesn't like any music. At all. She says it's just irritating noise, so I got used to wearing headphones a lot. The hardest part was that if anyone upset her (regardless of intention), she would just... stop talking to everyone for days at a time. When I was little she would keep making meals, doing chores, bedtimes etc, all just in silence. I'm in my 30s now, and we've got a really good relationship. I don't visit her often but we talk 3-4 times a week.

Sooooo for you I could recommend trying to keep a purse/backpack with emergency supplies (basic first aid, a knife, flashlight, tampons/pads, a hand towel or two, even snacks, a water bottle, etc etc etc), emergency mechanical supplies in your trunk (car jack, oil, jumper cables, etc), set reminders on your phone for bills or important events, and remember to always breathe! The idea is so you can go enjoy yourself knowing that even if something happens you'll be able to take care of the problem easily. Tire flat? No problem! Cut yourself? Easy. Caught out in the dark? Make it less dark. Can't forget bills if your phone is in reach. I would also recommend keeping a smart watch on you.

t3_nldylb,eli5 why is burning calories such a slow process compared to accumulating them?,gzi3r61,"&gt; why is burning calories such a slow process compared to accumulating them? You are thinking about this the wrong way. Your body is a very efficient machine that burns just as many calories as it needs. This is a fairly consistent amount of calories that you can estimate by [using a calculator](https://tdeecalculator.net/), and you can then confirm by weighing your food and weighing yourself for a couple of weeks. The rate that your body burns calories can be increased slightly by your activity level, but there are limits to how much you can increase it. So if you eat only as many calories as your body needs, burning them is not a slower process than accumulating them - it is the exact same speed. If you eat fewer calories than your body needs, burning them is a faster process than accumulating them and you lose weight. If you view food as nothing more than fuel for your body that takes time, money, and effort to consume, the question then becomes why do people expend more resources than necessary to consume calories they don’t need and their bodies can’t burn?",1081

Even if you’re super attractive and charming, sometimes in that environment that’s the last thing on someone’s mind, but still you didn’t even do anything wrong. That encounter couldn’t really have been drawn out without risking her getting uncomfortable or something or you saying something actually cringe worthy. I’m not the smoothest guy but for me I basically “fake it till’ I make it”, which is just me being overtly confident. I get some sort of facade over me and just speak to girls and anyone as if it’s nothing. I’m not saying this is the foolproof strategy, as it may just work for me, but I think having some misplaced confidence can go a long way. Again, probably not the best idea to be talking up people at their jobs, but in this case you kept it short and it was nothing wrong, and who knows, maybe after enough conversations, you can ask her out. Doesn’t matter if she says yes or no, it’s just about taking that chance, and if she says no, you move onto the next person, easy.

t3_nmguuv,When is the best time to reveal your villains motivation?,gzoht21,"It depends on how important the villain’s motivation is to the plot, and how soon you want the reader to know. Sometimes, the motivation is obvious from the beginning. Sometimes it seems obvious, but then the actual motivation is revealed midway through, or even at the end. And of course sometimes it is a complete mystery until the middle or end. What I often find with this one though, is that if the motivation is not at all clear by that point, it’s often because we (the audience) don’t know who the villain is yet, or the villain is more of a shadowy character about whom very little is known. Once the villain is found, their motivation usually becomes known soon afterwards, or in the case of mysteries, we start to learn about the motivation first, then connect that to a suspect to get a full picture. Certainly, having the villain’s motivation gradually revealed over time works too, but it’s not the only good approach. It’s really up to you :)",957

Years later, I got my TI-85 and wrote a program that would do all my geometry work for me. My biggest tips are: 1. Learn by doing things you are really excited about. Trudging through boring work teaches little and doesn't instill the tenacity needed to become the best. 2. Be an unstoppable force.

t3_nmvkdn,ELI5: Why is Iron the boundary between nuclear fusion and fission. What makes it so unique?,gzr7i71,"That has got to do with the binding energy of the core. Now what is binding energy? It's essentially the energy that you need to break a core apart. Now why is that important, well one could assume that the weight of a core is the same as the sum of weights of it's consituent parts, but it isn't. The core is usually lighter than the sum of it's parts, which is call mass defect. Now according to Einstein and his famous formula E=mc², mass (m) and energy (E) are directly related through a constant (c=speed of light), so you essentially a difference in energy between the core and what you'd get if you break it apart. Which is aptly called the ""binding energy"". So it's essentially the energy that you get by having a core over having parts. Meaning the creation of the core released energy and to break apart the core you'd need to resupply it with energy. So if you look at the graph displaying the binding energy of cores per nucleon (parts of the core), you'll find this: https://opentextbc.ca/universityphysicsv3openstax/chapter/nuclear-binding-energy/ So if you take 2 hydrogen atoms (consisting of a proton and a neutron) with a binding energy of ~1MeV per nucleon and fuse them to make helium (consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons or the the stuff in 2 hydrogens) then you realize that you went from 1MeV/nucleon for ²H to 7MeV per nucleon for ⁴He. So you start from 4 nucleons at 1MeV = 4MeV to 4 nucleons at 7MeV = 28MeV now removing the 4MeV to break up the hydrogens you get 24MeV of energy from that reaction. Consersely if you break idk U235 into Ba142 and Kr91 the difference is much smaller let's say U235 are very roughly around ~7.5MeV and the other two are very roughly ~8.5MeV than you'd get a ~1MeV per nucleon which sounds like way less but you'd get that 235 times. So as long as the result of either fusion or fission ends up having a higher binding energy than the stuff you fused or broke apart you would gain the difference in binding energy. However if you look closely iron is the core with the highest binding energy so both fusion and fission would require not provide you with energy.",2122
t3_nmw06i,Deleuze's theory of desire - desire as a productive force?,gzr7wcp,"It's been a while since I read ""Capitalism &amp; Schizophrenia"", so I don't know the lingo too well anymore. But this idea of desire as productive force is something very much in line with Deleuze's poststructural way of thinking, so that you can't really say ""A desires B"" as if desire was a relation between two separate, static subjects. It's more like that when A desires B, B gets constituted in this process, same as this desiring also transforms A. It's not like ""A produces an image of B"" - that's not what ""productive"" means for Deleuze (and Guattari) and that's why he's talking about ""reality"". In desiring A as well as B get transformed and bcome something other. Furthermore, one thing Deleuze emphasizes often is that you don't usually desire a specific thing, but a ""assamblage"" - meaning that what A desires in B is a manifoldness of processes (things that A associates with B for example). I'm not sure how this relates to the idea of productive force in Deleuze, but it should also relate to this non-structuralist idea.",1038

t3_nnrwyj,"Don't philosophies that revolve around finding contentment in suffering (Stoicism, Absurdism, etc.) leave you open to be manipulated/exploited?",gzxfc46,"I don't think any of these philosophies advocate for the individual to simply accept the suffering that cruel or sadistic individuals can inflict. They are more about unavoidable suffering, as you rightly pointed out. That acceptance is more about avoiding the internal struggle and increased suffering that comes from wrestling internally with a situation that cannot be resolved. This is very similar to mindfulness practice in psychology (largely derived from Buddhist thought), and the concept of ""second arrows"", where the ""first arrow"" is your reaction to pain or discomfort, and the ""second arrow"" is your response to the ""first arrow"", usually unproductive ruminative or circular thoughts. We can't make change while still obsessed with our feelings about our past feelings.",782
t3_nnu9rc,How does one start investing ?,gzwezrl,"Think about companies or ideologies that interest you. Example: you're familiar with the tech world, you can aquire securities (stocks) in certain companies you believe will do well. If you're into supporting the environment, looking into green companies. After you have an idea of what you want to invest in, look into different brokers. Some offer little to no cost for trades, but you have to investigate what their drawbacks are for the price and ability. Always keep in mind past value of a security will not dictate future value. Just because a company has always done well doesn't mean it's guaranteed (granted more likely.)",631
t3_nnu8od,People whose parents are 50+ y.o : How do you handle their mood swings and tantrums?,gzxk1po,Elderly parent tantrum survivor here. For context although i love him profusely my old father will begin to scream and throw shit when he loses something or is irritated. Has done it since sixty no dementia present. to answer your question Ive tried comforting. Mostly I shut it down. like i don’t allow it to continue and i say stop this is ridiculous you can’t throw a tantrum and this is an abuse of my emotions. and that he needs to deal with his emotions and problems like everyone else . that honestly has worked. I’m not cruel when i say it but firm and understanding and i validate his emotions but not behavior. Then i help the situation like help him find the thing he lost. Beware this is a bit of an escalation and may agitate. I’m experimenting with different methods. In the future i’m going to try ignoring it and staring at him until he realizes what he’s doing bc honestly interfering and calming him down is a huge emotional toll on me. It’s less stress on me,977

t3_no1fmj,ELI5 : Why do we get irritable when hungry ?,h002q03,"Successful life-forms evolve reflex behaviours where they react to states of potential harm in ways which tend to act to reduce the potential harm. Lacking nutrients is an example of such a state of potential harm. A state of irritation is a state where the life-form is energized to act in certain ways (e.g. foraging for food, escaping a hostile situation) which are likely to reduce or avoid the potential harm. By contrast, a state of quiescence or passivity is a state where the life-form is ""de-energised"". It comes about as a reflex reaction to certain conditions in which being quiet, still and/or saving energy tend to reduce or avoid the potential harm. Sadly the reflex behaviors of humans are often not well-tuned to their modern societal environment and this often leads to negative outcomes. For example, getting irrtated at, and abusive to, the staff in a restaurant generally does not mean that your hunger will be satisfied more quickly. For a more advanced understanding look up the term homeostasis.",1018

Or is she just house bound? If it was my son (7yo), the first step would be to change his sleep schedule, to wake up later, go to bed later. That way, she could enjoy the outside in evening or much later in the day because I suppose her bedtime is between 7pm and 8pm? As for during the day activities, if you have the space for it, bring a small inflatable pool inside and “go to the beach” with a picnic or something. The same would apply for an area with sand, if she is allowed to get dirty (I don’t know if she still has stitches or if the wounds are closed). Not for everyday, but once in a while. Family barbecues in the evening, strolls in the evening and so on, as long as your parents are up for a change in her schedule. I know they might love their “alone time” in the evening, but keeping a 5yo for the whole summer inside during day is going to be hard… My son broke his arm when he was 5, in the spring, and he couldn’t ride his bike and just that was hell.",1059

t3_nolayz,Is it possible to write a good fantasy trilogy as a debut?,h011c8y,"I don't think you need to write short stories. I've written, like, two. I prefer novels. But I'm going to be honest. I do think you're expecting too much from yourself if you're expecting your first written work to be objectively good. Even studying beforehand will not prepare you sufficiently. You don't get good at writing without actually writing. A *lot*. I've heard ""five million words"" thrown about as a figure but I suspect this differs for everyone. Writing is a skill. It requires practice. Nobody sits down at a piano for the first time and plays Chopin flawlessly, no matter how much they've studied beforehand. Fingers on keys: that's what matters. The good news is that you're 44k words into your total, and that is a really amazing achievement! Seriously! Every word you write is pushing you towards your goal of writing A Good Book. You're on your way. The other good news is that nothing is stopping you from writing this trilogy, then writing a few more books, *then* coming back and editing your trilogy so it's objectively awesome, the way it deserves to be. You might also be that kind of fluke of a person who does dash out a cracking novel their very first time, but I don't think it's realistic to hang your hopes on this.",1246

A single bolt could power 56 homes for one day. But there's 139 million homes in the U.S. alone, so you would need about 2.5 million sky-to-ground strikes a day just to power every home. This does not include businesses that are taking tens of kilowatts or industries measuring their draw sometimes in several megawatts or more, just homes. Since there's 22 million strikes a year and we need over 900 million just to power *just* the homes, it's already looking pretty grim in terms of cost to benefit. This is assuming we manage to capture every strike (even more expensive) and that weather plays in our favor. Then you have to build a storage system capable of taking a sudden surge of millions of volts and thousands of amps. That's an extremely tough one. Any battery or capacitor would pretty much instantly vaporize.",922

That's the thing, once you've gone through the act you're *going to sit and actually watch the fucking movie*.

Color is speculative and scientists will mostly look to nature to find answers. Reptiles and amphibians are a good start and this is what was mostly used in the past. Large mammals like elephants, rhinos and hippos were also used leading to the idea that dinosaurs would have been mostly drab, consisting of earth tones (the first three Jurassic Park movies come to mind when thinking of this). Once the link between dinosaurs and birds was established and the discovery that many dinosaurs had feathers science started looking at birds for color inspiration. Many modern depictions have wild patterns and colors similar to birds. Personally I would think it's somewhere in between; some probably had striking colors and patterns while others were probably more drab.",953
t3_noxy3p,"eli5 In public-private key encryption, what stops someone from decrypting using your public key?",h028p95,"I multiplied two numbers together and got 34916677 as the answer. Without using any factorizing tools tell me which two numbers I multiplied together to get that result. You likely won't be able to unless you go try every number one by one until you hit the right answer. However if I give you one of the numbers you can easily find the other. While not exactly the same the private/public keypair are a bit like that. The cryptographic properties we're interested in are arranged in such a way that the two operations: encrypting and decrypting, are really the same operation that just happen to cancel each other out. You can't use the public key to undo the public key because you need to go *the other way*. If you walk ten miles west walking a further ten miles west won't get you back to where you started. In order to undo the public key either you have to have the private key, or you have to guess billions of potential combinations until you hit something that happens to undo the public key. There is not easy way to find that number if you do not already know it, it's all about as hard as just guessing randomly.",1125

t3_np23bb,ELI5: why air planes can't harvest wind power as a source of renewable energy and use less fossil fuel?,h02tw58,"Big commercial airplanes do in fact have devices to use wind power to generate electricity. This devices is called a RAT (Ram air turbine) and usually only used in emergencies when the normal power generation in the engines no longer works. They are not used during normal flight. The reason is simply physics. Yo need to burn fuel to propel your vehicle forward and if you siphon some of the energy of the air rushing past the vehicle to generate power you need to burn even more fuel. It is inefficient. Still a plane will continue to fly or at least glide forward and downward even after all engines are turned off and you can use a bit of that energy to power important parts of the plane, it will slow the plane down a bit faster than it would otherwise, but that is acceptable. Ships that use wind power have the advantage that they are inside the water and the air at the same time. planes are just in the air. A ship can use the friction of the water slowing it down as a counterforce against the air trying to push it forward. This is how sailing works. You can do similar thing with land vehicles sort of with land sailing, but it doesn't really work for much except as a novelty. If you want to achieve something similar for a flying vehicle you would end up with something like a kite or a balloon.",1310

What the other commenters are saying isn't *strictly* correct, because they are assuming the solution to a famous unsolved computer science problem: that P is not equal to NP. The set of P problems are any problems that can be solved quickly The set of NP problems are problems whose solution can be verified quickly.
